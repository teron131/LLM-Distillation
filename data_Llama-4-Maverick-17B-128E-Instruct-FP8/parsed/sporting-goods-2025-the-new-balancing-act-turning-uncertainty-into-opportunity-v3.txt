The new balancing act:  
Turning uncertainty into opportunity  

Foreword

The World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) 
and McKinsey & Company are proud to present our fifth annual 
sporting goods industry report, Sporting Goods 2025—The new 
balancing act: Turning uncertainty into opportunity. Over the 
past year, the sporting goods industry has persevered through 
economic volatility, geopolitical tensions, and evolving consumer 
behavior. Slowing growth forecasts are compelling executives to 
focus equally on revenue growth and productivity improvements. 

Our most recent surveys, research, and analyses identified 
themes that offer both opportunities and challenges. We 
see a widening activity gap, with the overall share of inactive 
people increasing while the subset of active consumers further 
embraces the active lifestyle as part of their identity. At the 
same time, the competitive landscape is shifting, with challenger 
brands outpacing large incumbents in revenue growth and 
market share. Finally, the resurgence of in-person fitness and 
the blending of live sports and entertainment, including an 
increase in live sporting events, offer new avenues for growth.

As we look to 2025, the sporting goods industry faces a shifting 
landscape. By taking a balanced approach to granular growth 
and productivity while focusing on consumer engagement 
and emphasizing authenticity, companies can turn uncertainty 
into opportunity and thrive in the new landscape.

This report aims to provide the insights and strategies 
leaders need to navigate these complexities and capitalize 
on the emerging trends. We invite you to explore the 
findings and recommendations outlined in this report.

About the research 

This report features insights and perspectives from several research efforts. 

WFSGI Sporting Goods Industry Executives Pulse Check, December 2024. To gain a better understanding of 
how sporting goods executives are approaching 2025, McKinsey partnered with the World Federation of the 
Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) to survey 50 executives regarding their overall sentiment on the state of the 
industry and the factors that will matter most.

McKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer Survey, December 2024. We also surveyed more than 3,600 
consumers across Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States to explore their approach to physical 
activity, their interaction with live sports and entertainment, and their consumption of sportswear brands. Of this 
sample, we segmented 1,842 respondents who identified as active consumers. 

Additional research and analysis. We augmented our findings by reviewing publicly available sources (annual 
reports, company publications, and press releases). In addition, we undertook financial analysis on publicly 
traded companies to evaluate their performance and market shares. Furthermore, we conducted executive and 
expert interviews to gain deeper insights and validate our findings.

Sporting Goods 2025Executive summary

The sporting goods industry faced a difficult environment in 2024. Softer growth prospects, persistent 
inflation, and cautious consumer spending all tested companies’ resilience. Despite these hurdles, the 
industry managed to sustain a growth rate of 7 percent per annum from 2021 to 2024. The growth outlook for 
2024 to 2029 is projected at a slightly more modest 6 percent per annum, driven by a slowdown in the Asia–
Pacific, Western Europe, and Latin America regions.

This year’s report, Sporting Goods 2025—The new balancing act: Turning uncertainty into opportunity, 
highlights the dual agenda for sporting goods companies—a simultaneous focus on the top and bottom lines. 
Brands are up to the task. According to a recent WFSGI survey, 44 percent of industry executives are feeling 
optimistic or rather optimistic about 2025,1 a signal of their cautious confidence in seizing opportunities amid 
pervasive challenges. This report explores key themes that will shape the market and highlights consumer 
trends that could represent paths to growth.

Chasing elusive growth and rethinking the value chain 
In the first chapter of this report, we highlight the industry’s dual focus on revenue and productivity.  
With cautious consumers reevaluating their discretionary spending, companies must mitigate the lasting 
impact of inflation. 

The industry has another challenge on the horizon: Eighty-four percent of sporting goods executives 
expressed concern about the impact of the geopolitical environment on their business.2 Potential tariff 
increases this year could have a significant effect on the sporting goods industry, particularly in terms of 
pricing and supply chain management. Companies can prepare by accelerating efforts to derisk and diversify 
their supply chains. For example, they could review their supply chain footprints and inventory management 
practices as well as boost efficiency through increased automation and digitalization.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability remain priorities for sporting goods 
companies, but external factors and business considerations are forcing executives to make difficult trade-
offs, leading to a decreased priority compared with last year. For 2025, half of surveyed sporting goods 
executives stated that sustainability is a priority for their company—down from approximately two-thirds the 
previous year.3 In addition, the chapter emphasizes the need for supply chain diversification to mitigate risks.

In the remaining four chapters, we drill down into further key themes that will likely feature on executive 
agendas in the year ahead.

Physical inactivity as the biggest untapped market
Despite the significant benefits of physical activity, the share of adults who are inactive jumped from  
26 percent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2022. More alarmingly, this trend could endure in the coming years, with 
the World Health Organization projecting inactivity levels to reach 35 percent by 2030.4

Physical inactivity also presents an existential risk to the sporting goods industry. If levels continue to rise or 
even remain constant for younger generations, the market related to physical activity will decline. However, 
converting physically inactive segments is the biggest potential opportunity for the sporting goods industry. The 
global population that is currently not meeting WHO’s recommended levels of physical activity totals 1.8 billion—
an untapped market equivalent to twice the size of India’s adult population. 

The good news is that sporting goods companies have an opportunity to take targeted action to empower 
sedentary consumers to increase their physical activity levels. They could seek to remove barriers to physical 
activity for more sedentary segments, focusing on product innovation, marketing campaigns to raise 
awareness, and enhanced youth engagement. For example, Adidas’s Stay in Play product line and Nike’s

modest wear line aim to address specific consumer barriers, while initiatives such as New Balance’s Run 
Your Way campaign and ASICS’s The Desk Break campaign raise awareness and promote physical activity. 
Shimano is collaborating with school bicycle clubs to teach children how to ride a bike and raise awareness 
about cycling.

Active lifestyle as identity
While physical inactivity has reached record levels around the world, there is also a consumer segment that 
is increasingly active. McKinsey’s latest survey of these active consumers in the sporting goods industry 
revealed an expanding gap in activity levels, with physically inactive and active cohorts drifting ever further 
apart.5 For those already engaged in activity, exercise has evolved from a casual pursuit into a linchpin 
of health regimens and a defining element of personal identity. This shift stretches beyond the decade-
long athleisure trend, heralding a deeper transformation in which an active lifestyle has become a central 
touchstone for a growing share of consumers.

This trend presents an opportunity for sporting goods brands to develop products that meet the emotional 
and functional needs of active consumers and foster long-term loyalty. Understanding the deeper motivations 
behind consumer choices allows brands to create offerings that resonate on a personal level, enhancing 
product design and marketing strategies.

Market share reshuffle
Over the past decade, the sporting goods market has witnessed a proliferation of new entrants, including 
both general apparel players—which have strategically expanded their portfolios to feature activewear—and 
specialized players, each offering a tightly focused value proposition for segments such as running, yoga, 
cycling, or gym attire. This specialization has enabled challenger brands to tap more deeply into the identity 
of consumers that gravitate toward brands that feel more “for me” rather than “for anyone.” Coupled with 
declining barriers to entry, this specialization has fueled the rise of challenger brands. In a telling sign of industry 
realignment, these contenders have eclipsed large incumbents Adidas and Nike in revenue growth and hence 
market share gains. From 2019 to 2024, publicly traded challenger brands expanded at a faster rate than major 
incumbents; the two largest players ceded three percentage points of market share during this period.6 

How have newer brands managed to expand their market share so rapidly? At a high level, they have focused 
on pursuing specific pockets of growth and expanding their reach in several ways: crafting a sharper value 
proposition, delivering visible innovation with platform potential, tapping into cultural marketing, and 
harnessing wholesale and selective retail.

Sporting Goods 2025This dynamic raises a dilemma for ambitious brands: how best to continue their growth journey and increase 
market share while retaining the attributes that distinguished them in the marketplace. The report explores 
two potential archetypes for future growth: stand-alone brands built through successful growth recipes and 
houses of brands formed through acquisitions. To maintain their competitiveness, sporting goods executives 
would need to objectively assess their strengths and extend their reach. 

Boom of blended live sports and entertainment
The industry is observing a resurgence of in-person fitness as well as live events. This dynamic presents 
opportunities for sporting goods companies to reassess their business models, marketing strategies, and 
customer outreach. 

Consumers have flocked to in-person fitness options. The McKinsey Sporting Goods Report Consumer 
Survey found 81 percent of respondents attended in-person fitness classes in the past year—nearly two and 
a half times as many as those who used online fitness classes. Consumers choose in-person fitness classes 
to boost their motivation and consistency, to benefit from the group energy, and to increase their sense of 
community or belonging and meet new people.

After the isolation experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the past couple of years have seen a 
persistent surge in attendance for live events. McKinsey estimates the global live events ticketing market 
surpassed $100 billion in 2023 and could reach $150 billion by 2030. This thirst for live experiences has led 
to more venues blending sports, entertainment, and retail; new sports formats featuring competition and 
spectacle; and more sports-based content. 

As consumers increasingly seek community-oriented fitness experiences with an entertainment angle, 
brands that can effectively combine in-person and digital offerings will be well-positioned to thrive. In addition, 
brands could capitalize on the intersection of sports and entertainment by partnering with other players or 
producing their own live events, creating unique opportunities for brand engagement and loyalty. 

The past year has marked a period of recalibration for the sporting goods industry, with uneven recoveries and 
persistent challenges. Looking ahead, we believe the most successful brands will innovate to address shifting 
consumer demands, manage supply chain complexity, and streamline operations. Through efforts in these areas 
and a sharp focus on execution, the industry will be well placed to continue on its positive trajectory.

Sporting Goods 2025Sporting goods at a glance 2025

The Sporting Goods 2025 report reviews the industry’s 
latest developments and explores how different consumer 
attitudes toward sport are affecting the industry. This 
year, we are continuing to emphasize the alarming levels 
of physical inactivity globally—a problem that private 
and public stakeholders should strive to address.

uncertainty.

Physical inactivity represents an 
untapped market opportunity of 1.8 
billion people—double the size of 
India’s adult population—the single 
largest growth potential.

Sporting Goods 20253. Active lifestyle as identity

1 in 2  

active consumers 
reported that fitness  
is a core element of  
their identity.

As physical activity is shifting 
from casual interest to a top 
priority for health and identity 
for consumers who are already 
active, sporting goods players 
need to sharpen their value 
proposition and connect with 
these consumers at an emotional 
level to be their brand of choice.

4. Market share upheaval with large incumbents being challenged to up their game

3% 

of market share has 
been lost by large 
incumbents and captured 
by challenger brands 
between 2019 and 2024.

5. Boom of live sports and blurring lines with entertainment

$150 billion  

live-ticketing market size 
value is expected by  
2030, up by $50 billion 
compared with 2023.

The battle for market share 
will likely intensify in 2025 as 
more challenger brands win 
by targeting specific growth 
pockets and expanding reach. 
Executives may need to rethink 
their approach to growth.

Consumers’ hunger for live 
experiences increasingly blurs 
boundaries between sports, 
retail, and entertainment, 
creating an opportunity for 
sporting goods players to boost 
loyalty and engagement and 
reach new consumers.

Sporting Goods 2025Being prepared for an 
uncertain world 

Jack Daly, CEO, TRX

How tough was it for the industry to 
grow in 2024? How has TRX thrived 
during market challenges? 

From an industry perspective, growth 
was challenging in 2024 because of a 
confluence of different trends. We’re 
dealing with a post-COVID-19 hangover 
in which some consumers still work out 
at home while others have returned 
to the gym. This has caused capital to 
fluctuate and then pause as the industry 
tries to find its footing. Businesses are 
hunkering down because we don’t know 
where the growth pockets will be. So the 
2024 market was flat for the most part. 
Also, in a macroeconomic sense, the 
consumer hasn’t been terribly healthy. 

A few years ago, people had disposable 
income. Right now, they seem stressed, 
so they’ve tightened their belts. Our 
high value, low-cost products allow us 
to thrive in a cost-conscious market by 
enabling consumers to fit an entire gym 
in a bag with a TRX Suspension Trainer 
to do strength, cardio, mobility, yoga, 
and Pilates.

As a result, companies are creating 
partnerships versus launching new 
products. They’re also making smart, 
fiscally conservative moves such as 
activating their brands. For example, 
with the TRX Training Summit, we 
gathered approximately a thousand 
people in Athens, Greece, for a two-day 

‘  A few years ago, people  
had disposable income. Right 
now, they seem stressed, so 
they’ve tightened their belts.’

workout event. Those are important 
types of activations for us because they 
drive excitement for the brand. 

We’ve been fortunate to launch new 
products by leveraging strategic 
innovation. For example, in 2023, we 
acquired YBell, which makes a piece of 
fitness equipment that is a kettlebell, 
dumbbell, medicine ball, and push-up 
stand all in one accessory. We found 
a product that fits our ecosystem and 
brought it to the market. We’re able to do 
this on the commercial side as well. For 
example, Orange Theory is launching 
YBell right now in its gyms. So we are 
finding growth not only through brand 
activations but also through innovative 
products. 

The share of consumers who say that 
a fitness, wellness, or sports routine is 
part of their identity is growing every 
single year. What are you noticing 
about how consumers are associating 
with your brand? 

I believe that health and wellness will 
become more important to people over 
the next five to ten years. There are 

Jack Daly is the owner and CEO of TRX, a leader in functional training equipment. In 
2022, he partnered with TRX founder Randy Hetrick to reacquire the company and 
has since revitalized its brand. Prior to acquiring TRX, Jack was a partner at Goldman 
Sachs and then at TPG Capital, leading large private equity buyouts in the industrials 
and services sector.

12

Sporting Goods 2025three components propelling this trend. 
One is the general public deciding that 
health and wellness is important to 
them; the second is the general public 
becoming more fit; and the third is 
that people are learning more about 
healthy living through social media and 
podcasts. While I’m more focused on 
North America, I see this shift happening 
globally. Health, wellness, and fitness 
have become much more part of the 
culture not only in the US but also in 
Europe and Asia, while emerging in the 
Middle East. Young people are choosing 
to go to the gym and work out instead 
of going to a bar. And while the interest 
from younger people is growing quickly, 
so is the interest and participation from 
aging people. There’s a 59-year-old 
Canadian woman, for example, who just 
posted the women’s record for push-
ups. So aging people are expecting to be 
able to stay fit and active, too.

Functional strength training has become 
more important to offset the muscle loss 
associated with increasingly popular 
GLP-1 treatments, which is a significant 
tailwind for TRX. People also want more 
than just fitness. They’re doing hot and 
cold training, breath training, meditation, 
and nutrition services. There are gyms 
that cater a full suite of services for 
healthy living. We’re seeing these trends 
becoming part of our global culture. 
Today’s consumers are looking for 
something far beyond exercise—they 
want a lifestyle.  

What exciting things have customers 
and trainers done with your brand in 
the past year? And how does social 
media play a role? 

Let me start with social media, because 
it plays a crucial role in the relationship 
between the brand and the consumer 
right now. Through our millions of 
followers on our social media platforms, 
we encourage people to tag each other 
and talk about not only what they’re 
doing with TRX gear but also innovative 
ideas for healthy living. For example, 
Pilates is a hot topic. Customers will 
post a side-by-side comparison of 
themselves using a suspension trainer 
to do their Pilates versus using a $4,000 
piece of equipment such as a reformer. 

‘ Health, wellness, and fitness 
have become deeply ingrained 
in the culture—not only in  
the US, but also across Europe 
and Asia, and it is emerging 
in the Middle East as well.’

Our more than 300,000 certified 
trainers from around the world will 
also experiment with equipment and 
workouts and share their stories, which 
we’ll repost. Our customers and trainers 
will activate our products and services in 
a cool, fun way, and then tell everybody 
about them.

We’re in a very different world right now, 
but that’s not necessarily specific to TRX. 
The entire industry is being shaped by 
these trends. Health and wellness has 
become a space where you can adopt 
whatever works for you. The amount of 
information out there, the accessibility, 
and the way people share their lifestyle—
they’re all making people say, “I didn’t 
even know you could do that.”

What’s top of mind when it comes  
to supply chain management for you 
and your team?

We focus on achieving world-class 
performance on top KPIs such as 
on-time delivery. Our supply chain was 
troubled when we acquired TRX in 
2022. Top of mind for our supply chain 
was fixing what we had and rebuilding 
it, so we gathered great talent from top 
brands for their global warehousing and 
supply chain experience. We moved our 
inventory into world-class facilities with 
the right systems and controls in place. 
We’ve gone from a mom-and-pop supply 
chain to one that is robust with enviable 
metrics by any measure. It’s become a 
competitive weapon for us because it 
delivers our products on time. 

We also looked at where we are sourcing 
our goods from. There are big-picture 

and global security issues to consider, 
which, over the next couple years, 
might affect tariffs, ocean rates, or 
planning routes. When encountering 
local geopolitical headwinds, you need 
to think strategically about the way you 
work with ports and, for example, lock 
up capacity by going into other ports 
before any problems start. That way, 
if you have to pivot, you’re prepared. 
However, in that kind of situation, many 
companies have taken the products that 
are available but then suffer from delays 
and incomplete shipments. If you’re 
doing things the right way, when that 
port shuts down, you’re already diverted 
to another port, or you’ve already bulked 
up on inventory. That’s what I mean about 
being prepared, because the supply 
chain is, at its core, an uncertain world.

Sporting Goods 2025Chasing elusive 
growth and rethinking 
the value chain

14

Sporting Goods 2025In 2024, sporting goods executives had the 
unenviable task of adapting business strategy to 
balance often conflicting trends. Softening growth, 
increasingly discerning consumers, geopolitical 
tensions, and sustainability commitments all shaped 
the landscape. Despite these challenges, some 
companies charted a hard-won path to growth.

Key insights

1.  Softer growth outlook: The sporting goods industry saw an annual growth rate of 7 percent 

from 2021 to 2024, down from 8 percent prepandemic. Projected growth is expected to soften 
further to 6 percent annually from 2024 to 2029, driven by slower growth in key regions. Overall, 
consumer behavior has shifted toward more cautious spending, with a preference for value 
products and essential purchases.

2.  Dual challenges on the top and bottom lines: In response to economic challenges and 
consumer caution observed in 2024, executives plan to balance efforts between revenue 
growth and productivity improvements in 2025.

3.  Geopolitical uncertainty and potential tariff increases: Heightened geopolitical uncertainties 
and potential tariff increases pose significant risks for 2025, necessitating strategic adaptations 
in supply chain management.

4.  Slowed sustainability progress: Slowing progress on sustainability commitments highlights 
the need for renewed focus on sustainable product design, sourcing, and manufacturing 
practices.

Executive priorities

1.  Adapt to cautious consumer behavior: Address cautious consumer spending by offering 
value-driven products and maintaining flexibility in pricing and retail strategies to retain 
consumer loyalty and capture discretionary spending in key categories.

2.  Balance revenue and productivity: Focus equally on growing revenues and improving 

productivity to navigate the softer growth outlook, leveraging strategies that enhance both top- 
and bottom-line performance.

3.  Mitigate geopolitical risks: Accelerate efforts to derisk and diversify supply chains in response 

to geopolitical uncertainties, including potential tariff increases. This involves exploring 
alternative sourcing regions, investing in local manufacturing capabilities, and building strategic 
partnerships to ensure supply chain resilience.

4.  Implement high-impact carbon reduction measures: Focus on high-impact, cost-effective

Softer growth outlook and 
dual challenges on the 
top and bottom lines

Over the past year, sporting goods 
players responded to slower growth by 
following a dual agenda of improving  
both the top and bottom lines. On the 
revenue side, the global industry’s 
growth rate softened to 7 percent 
annually from 2021 to 2024, a percentage  
point lower than during the prepandemic 
era of 2017 to 2019 (Exhibit 1). Estimates 
suggest the outlook for 2024 to 2029 
could be even softer—about 6 percent 

a year—because of reduced growth 
in Asia–Pacific, Western Europe, and 
Latin America.1 Despite these mixed 
prospects, 44 percent of sporting goods 
executives feel optimistic or rather 
optimistic about the industry in 2025, and 
approximately 40 percent were neutral.2

How did companies fare in this challenging 
environment? Our analysis found leaders—
those able to excel in both revenue and 
productivity—were the exception. In 
fact, since 2018, just three in ten publicly 
traded sporting goods companies 
outpaced the market on revenue growth 

while increasing margins (Exhibit 2). At 
the other end of the scale, one in three 
companies trailed the market on growth 
and experienced shrinking margins. 

Looking ahead to the rest of 2025,  
50 percent of sporting goods executives 
plan to focus on raising revenues and 
improving productivity simultaneously.3  
About one-quarter of respondents said 
they would emphasize the top line, while 
the remaining one-quarter reported 
that they are prioritizing improved 
productivity.4

Cautious consumers  
trading down and purchasing 
more thoughtfully

Although inflation has recently been falling, 
its specter still looms large for sporting 
goods companies and consumers. Two in 
three executives worry about the lasting 
impact of inflation on demand.5 While 
consumer confidence is slowly recovering 
from the decline of 2022, shoppers 

remain cautious about their spending and 
are prioritizing nondiscretionary items 
(Exhibit 3). The McKinsey Consumer 
Sentiment Survey found that 25 percent 
of EU respondents are pessimistic, and 51 
percent have mixed feelings about their 
country’s economic conditions.6

This sentiment isn’t markedly better 
across the Atlantic. Slightly more than 
half of US consumers remain wary of 

inflation’s effects despite its decline. 
Inflation remains the top concern, 
prompting consumers to trade down, 
reduce quantities, or delay purchases.7

Economic concerns are also causing 
consumers to reevaluate where to buy 
sporting goods. More than eight in ten 
consumers consider multiple retailers 
before purchasing. In addition, they are 
increasingly trading down and shifting 

‘ Looking ahead to 2025, the industry will focus 
on driving top-line and bottom-line growth, as 
focusing just on one of the two will not be enough.’

to lower-price retailers or discounters—
suggesting a decreased overall level of 
loyalty toward sporting goods retailers.8

Some categories are expected to be 
more resilient in the face of inflation. 
For example, apparel and footwear, 
including sportswear, are among the 
top five categories in which EU and US 
consumers, particularly Gen Zers and 
millennials, report an intent to splurge.9  

Geopolitical uncertainty and 
potential tariff increases

The industry has another challenge 
on the horizon: 84 percent of sporting 
goods executives expressed concern 
about the impact of the geopolitical 
environment on their business.10

Global trade demonstrated resilience 
over the past year in the face of 
geopolitical tensions around the world. 
According to UNCTAD, it is estimated 
to have increased by 3.3 percent to a 

record $33 trillion in 2024.11 However, the 
outlook for the coming year is clouded 
by the potential of escalating trade wars, 
international policy shifts, and continued 
geopolitical conflicts.

Potential tariff increases this year could 
have a significant impact on the sporting 
goods industry, particularly in terms of 
pricing and supply chain management. In 
addition, consumer spending may be  
affected even further, especially in discre- 
tionary categories such as sporting goods. 

Companies can prepare by accelerating 
efforts to derisk and diversify their 
supply chains. For example, they could 
review their supply chain footprints and 
inventory management practices as well 
as boost efficiency through increased 
automation and digitalization. 

Slowed sustainability progress 

Environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) factors and sustainability 

remain priorities for sporting goods 
companies, but external factors and 
business considerations are forcing 
executives to make difficult trade-offs 
leading to a lower priority compared 
with last year. For 2025, half of surveyed 
sporting goods executives stated 
that sustainability is a priority for their 
company—down from approximately 
two-thirds the previous year.12 Further,  
44 percent acknowledge the importance 
of sustainability but are currently 
focusing on other business initiatives, 
an increase of 11 percentage points from 
2023.13 The reality is that sporting goods 
companies often have to balance short-
term factors such as inflation, inventory 
levels, and cost of capital with long-term 
sustainability goals. 

Consumers are similarly conflicted. 
According to McKinsey’s research 
and analysis for State of Retail 2024—
Europe, just one in three respondents 
pay attention to the sustainability of the

sporting goods products they purchase.14 
This finding is in line with other categories, 
such as furniture, beauty and personal 
care, and consumer electronics products. 

Despite these complications, sporting 
goods companies have kept their 
commitments to net-zero targets, 
although their progress shows signs of 
slowing. Overall, 52 percent of surveyed 
companies have set CO2 reduction 
targets, and 22 percent are in the midst 
of discussions and plan to announce their 
targets within the next year.15

Companies are adopting comprehensive 
strategies to address environmental impact 
and reduce CO2 emissions—recognizing 
sustainability as a critical lever for long-
term business success and environmental 
stewardship. Last year’s edition of this 
report highlighted ten levers sporting 

goods executives could pull to reach net-
zero emissions by 2050 (Exhibit 4).16

term business goals.

For this report, we surveyed sporting goods 
executives to understand which levers 
they have focused on. According to the 
survey, the main CO2 reduction levers for 
70 percent of executives were sustainable 
product design and assortment and 
sustainable sourcing.17 Additionally, 60 
percent of respondents are concentrating 
on sustainable manufacturing practices.18 
Approximately 55 percent are focusing on 
the tracking, prioritization, and operational 
improvements for emission reductions, as 
well as adapting the product life cycle to 
enable circularity.19 

These insights underscore the industry’s 
commitment to integrating sustainability 
into various facets of their operations, 
reflecting a holistic approach to reducing

untapped market potential of addressing 
physical inactivity, the subset of active 
consumers who further embrace an active  
lifestyle as part of their identity, the compet- 
itive dynamics reshaping market share, and 
the trends influencing the industry, including 
the resurgence of in-person fitness and 
the growing demand for live experiences. 
Each theme presents unique opportunities 
and challenges, offering valuable insights 
for industry leaders seeking to navigate the 
future landscape successfully.

intensifies and the market does not  
grow as expected.

Why is this overbuild occurring?

For footwear or any sporting goods 
manufacturers, it takes time to build our 
capacity in one country. It took us four 
to five years to build up our operations 
in Vietnam. When we enter a new 
country, we need to get to know the 
local infrastructure, local labor laws, and 
regulations or environmental protections. 

We also have to prebuild our capacities 
before we can work with major 

brands and receive more orders. The 
conventional wisdom was to build 
capacities once we saw the orders 
coming in, but because the competition 
among brands and among manufacturers 
is intensifying, whoever builds capacity 
first will get the orders. 

A lot of sporting goods brands 
have overbuilt in Vietnam; 60 or 70 
percent of their total orders placed 
are manufactured in Vietnam. And 
many other industries are moving 
their manufacturing there because of 
Vietnam’s duty-free status with European 
countries. This also means they’re 
competing for the same labor pool, so 
labor costs are driven higher. A lot of 
brands are now trying to diversify that 
risk by sending their manufacturers to 
India or Indonesia.

How are Victory Group and other 
sporting goods manufacturers 
preparing to navigate supply chain 
challenges in 2025?

We are focused on enhancing 
productivity and quality. We are also 
diversifying into Indonesia to alleviate the 
risk of being too concentrated in Vietnam. 

Like a lot of manufacturers, we are 
focusing on automation and digitalization 

What surprised you most about 2024, 
and what were the biggest challenges 
Victory Group faced?  

We manufacture shoes for multiple 
brands, and some of the brands that had 
a big downturn in 2023 surged in demand 
in 2024. We ended up reopening a facility 
we closed in 2023 and rehiring its workers 
so we could rush to meet demand. 

Now we can see the competition 
intensifying among the brands we 
serve. New sporting goods brands that 
offer more-innovative products with 
competitive pricing are coming to the 
market. So existing brands are trying to 
defend their turf. 

A lot of big brands moved to where they 
manufacture their products. We saw a 
surge of companies going into Indonesia 
and India. So the challenge down the 
road may be that there will be a huge 
overbuild in capacity if competition 
among sporting goods brands

Sporting Goods 2025to augment direct workers’ skills and 
help with the labor shortage as well as 
make sure that all the information across 
the supply chain is clearly documented 
and can be transferred to our customers 
and suppliers to avoid communication 
disruptions. Lean manufacturing 
has been key in the manufacturing 
industry, so we’ll be focusing on that as 
well, especially when we are adopting 
automation solutions. 

Many companies have made ESG and 
sustainability commitments. What is 
required from sportswear companies  
to increase recycling and reduce  
carbon intensity? 

It takes a lot of cooperation across the 
entire supply chain, from the brand to the 
manufacturer to the tier-two and tier-three 
suppliers. The manufacturing industry is 
quite fragmented. For example, you might 
have a footwear factory serving different 
brands and a material supplier supplying 
different brands and factories. Tracking 
the footprint of a product is complex, and 
manufacturers will have to figure out which 
data they can use and how to create a 
common platform among their suppliers. 

They will also have to figure out how 
to properly recycle their products. For 
footwear, for example, you have the 
upper part of the shoe and the sole, 
which are glued together. Now we’ll have 
to figure out how to take them apart  
and de-manufacture things to recycle 
them properly.

Apparel is easier to recycle and resell 
than footwear. You can’t resell footwear 
in the same way, especially after it’s 
been worn for several years. A large 
part of circularity in footwear is in the 

recyclable materials, we can apply those 
techniques to our innovations. 

We are also looking at other innovations, 
such as 3D printing, to use in 
manufacturing. For example, we could 
blend recycled materials into 3D printing 
compounds and make that a means of 
building products.

Another part of the innovation may come 
from materials as we try to get away 
from using petrol-based materials. For 
example, color selections often become 
limited when you use recycled materials, 
which limits the function of the product, 
so we can find ways to make recycled 
products beautiful and eye-catching.

disassembly process to separate the 
parts of a shoe, which will be the biggest 
challenge because it will require big 
investments.

What ESG priorities are you seeing 
brands demand?

Most of the demands are centered on 
tracking the data as well as making sure 
that the materials are recycled or can 
be recycled. There’s an initiative called 
Made to be Remade that is trying to 
improve recyclability, which requires us to 
register all the information needed about 
a product to trace it. More brands are 
encouraging us to use recycled or green 
materials, even though they may have to 
pay more. So on our end, we’re focusing 
mostly on the information tracking aspect 
of this to source materials.  

How can brands progress toward 
becoming net zero while still 
addressing other priorities in their 
business? 

Building a common platform on 
which brands can share data and 
best practices among manufacturers 
or brands is important. The cost of 
maintaining ESG compliance is very 
high, so if there is some sort of central 
hub of information that manufacturers 
and brands can use to learn from, then 
brands can work together to achieve 
their goals more easily. 

How can the footwear manufacturing 
industry drive innovation across the 
value chain? 

If we can learn from other industries, 
such as the auto parts industry, to see 
how they manage their supply chains

Sporting Goods 2025Physical inactivity as  
the biggest untapped  
market opportunity

22

Sporting Goods 2025Despite the significant and proven benefits of 
activity, physical inactivity has reached record 
levels around the world, with 31 percent of adults 
not meeting recommended activity levels.20 More 
alarming, this trend appears set to persist and even 
accelerate in the coming years. The good news is 
that sporting goods brands have an opportunity 
to take targeted action to empower sedentary 
consumers to increase their physical activity levels. 

Key insights

1.  Rising inactivity levels: 31 percent of adults globally are considered inactive, and the share 
is projected to increase to 35 percent by 2030, posing significant health, economic, and 
sustainability risks.

2.  Untapped market potential: With 1.8 billion adults—twice the size of India’s adult population—
not meeting the World Health Organization’s activity recommendations, physical inactivity 
presents a massive opportunity for the sporting goods industry.

3.  Significant intersectoral collaboration needed: While the sporting goods industry—with 
its knowledge, resources, and access to consumers—is well positioned to transform global 
physical activity, the challenge is far broader and calls for governments, educational institutions, 
employers, and healthcare professionals to further step up and collaborate.

Executive priorities

1.  Innovate to remove barriers: Develop products that address specific consumer barriers to 

physical activity, such as Adidas’s Stay in Play line and Nike’s modest wear.

2.  Campaign and market to raise awareness: Use marketing campaigns to promote inclusivity 
and the benefits of physical activity, similar to New Balance’s Run Your Way and ASICS’s  
Desk Break.

3.  Enhance youth engagement: Support youth and broader community engagement through 
coaching programs, sports camps and trainings, and accessible equipment to foster a more 
active lifestyle. Examples include Pentland’s Speedo Swim United initiative and Shimano’s 
school bicycle program.

Physical inactivity as  

the biggest untapped  

market opportunity

Sporting Goods 2025The wide-ranging benefits 
of physical activity

The World Health Organization (WHO) 
defines physical activity as any bodily 
movement produced by skeletal muscles 
that requires energy expenditure—such 
as walking, dancing, cycling, and playing 
sports. To maintain good health, WHO 
recommends a minimum of 60 minutes 
of moderate to vigorous physical activity 
a day for children and youth and at least 
150 minutes of moderate-intensity 
physical activity a week for adults.21

Engaging in physical activity on a con- 
sistent basis has benefits in several areas: 

Overall health and quality of life. Regular 
physical activity can avert preventable 
diseases such as heart disease, stroke, 
cancer, and type 2 diabetes—all of which 
can cause premature death. It also helps 
people manage chronic conditions, 
improving quality of life as well as 
reducing the risk of being overweight or 
obese. In addition, physical activity can 
help people lower their levels of anxiety, 
depression, and stress. 

Workforce and productivity. Healthier 
workers are more productive, generate 
more income taxes, and need less 
long-term sick leave. The OECD found 
that companies with workplace health 

programs tackling sedentary behavior 
can achieve a fourfold return on their 
investment.22

Sustainability. Shifting transportation 
and mobility toward more physical 
activity, including walking and cycling, 
can provide a dual benefit: improving 
community health while reducing 
environmental impact through lower 
carbon emissions and better air quality. 

Rising levels of physical 
inactivity around the globe

Despite these benefits, physical inactivity 
continues to rise, and it cannot be 
explained as a temporary setback or 
spike in inactivity associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Global physical 
inactivity in adults jumped from 26 
percent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2022 
(Exhibit 5).23 WHO projects that inactivity 
levels could reach 35 percent by 2030.24

In addition, 81 percent of youth 
(adolescents aged 11 to 17 years) do 
not engage in enough regular physical 
activity to maintain good health—a 
potential warning sign of higher levels of 
inactivity in the future. The youth of  
today will be the parents of tomorrow,  
and their sedentary lifestyles could serve 
as a poor example for their children.  

81%

of youth (adolescents  
aged 11 to 17 years) do  
not engage in enough 
regular physical activity  
to maintain good health.

The global population that is currently not 
meeting WHO’s recommended levels of  
physical activity totals 1.8 billion people—an 
untapped market opportunity equivalent  
to twice the size of India’s adult population.

Hence, fostering a more active lifestyle 
among today’s youth is essential to 
prevent further decline.

The price tag of inaction is significant. 
According to WHO estimates, current 
physical inactivity levels could cause 500 
million new cases of preventable health 
conditions by 2030, translating to a cost of 
$300 billion to public healthcare systems 
globally.25 As a result, funding that could be  
spent on preventive measures to reduce 
physical inactivity would instead go to 
managing and treating chronic conditions.

Physical inactivity also presents an 
existential risk to the sporting goods 

industry. If the younger generation does 
not become more active, the market 
related to physical activity will decline. At 
the same time, people who are physically 
inactive represent the biggest untapped 
market for the sporting goods industry. 
The global population that is currently 
not meeting WHO’s recommended 
levels of physical activity totals 1.8 billion 
people—an untapped market opportunity 
equivalent to twice the size of India’s 
adult population.26  

Gender. Since women (34 percent 
inactive) are less active compared with 
men (29 percent inactive), increasing 
women’s activity levels could have a 
multiplier effect. Consider that women 
are expected to control 75 percent of 
purchasing decisions by 2028, especially 
when it comes to discretionary spending 
such as sporting goods.27 They often 
purchase not only for themselves but 
also for their children, partners, or elderly 
family members.

Physical inactivity among adults varies by 
country and is influenced by socioeconomic 
factors, lifestyle, and policy initiatives:

Geography. Physical inactivity varies 
by geography, with the highest levels 
observed in the eastern Mediterranean

40 to 48 percent).28 As these regions 
become economic powerhouses with 
higher disposable incomes, establishing 
sports participation and activity as a 
desirable lifestyle will be critical.

Age. Physical inactivity rises rapidly at 
age 60 and above, a trend that poses 
a substantial challenge in a world with 
an aging population. At the same time, 
81 percent of young people (aged 11 
to 17 years) do not engage in enough 
regular physical activity to maintain good 
health—a potential warning sign of higher 
levels of inactivity in the future.  

How brands can help reverse 
the trajectory

Sporting goods companies could unlock 
a substantial opportunity by removing 
barriers to physical activity for more 
sedentary consumers. Three approaches 
hold promise, and some brands have 
already gotten started.

1. Innovate to remove barriers: Gear the 
product innovation engine to address 
specific consumer barriers  
Brands have an opportunity to mobilize 
consumer segments that may have been 
overlooked or underserved in the past. 
One strategy is to develop products 
that directly address the needs of 

specific segments. Adidas, for example, 
developed the Stay in Play product line 
to help women stay active. Products 
include period-proof tights, maternity 
bras, and trainers tailored to female foot 
characteristics. Similarly, Nike launched 
a line of modest clothing designs, 
including a swim hijab, to enable women 
to participate in sports activities while 
respecting cultural and religious customs.

2. Raise awareness: Employ marketing 
and campaigns to change perceptions 
and attract consumers to activity 
Directly targeting consumer segments 
that may be hesitant to become more 
active has proved effective. New Balance, 
for example, launched a cross-platform 
marketing campaign, Run Your Way, that 
positions running as an inclusive sport 
while raising consumers’ awareness 
of, and conversion to, the New Balance 
brand. For example, followers of  
@newbalancerunning on Instagram  
grew 34 percent in 2024.29 ASICS’s  
Desk Break campaign encourages 
people to step away from their desks and 
move to support their mental health. It 
has garnered more than 50 million views, 
reaching in excess of two billion people 
through media channels and leading 
thousands of workers around the world 
to take a #DeskBreak on World Mental 
Health Day.30  

3. Enhance youth engagement: 
Improve access through coaching 
support and community activation 
Increasing youth participation is critical 
to improving physical activity levels. 
Several sporting goods companies have 
employed their knowledge and resources 
to improve accessibility. 

Adidas runs the Breaking Barriers 
Academy, a free, online gender-equity 
training program for coaches and 
physical education teachers. The 
academy aims to increase the chances 
that youth will have early positive 
experiences, which can translate into 
ongoing physical activity. To date, 1,500 
users have engaged with the academy, 
and the numbers continue to rise.31  

Nike has teamed up with Dove, the 
personal-care brand owned by Unilever, 
to give coaches tools to build confidence 
in girls, addressing one of the main 
reason girls drop out of sports at a rate 
six times that of boys. Body Confident 
Sport is a first-of-its-kind, evidence-
based set of coaching tools that use 
sports to help build body confidence in 
girls ages 11 to 17. It is currently available 
in seven languages. Since its digital 
platform launched about 12 months ago, 
115,000 coaches have used it, with more 
than 12,000 coaches trained digitally or 
in person.32 

 Sporting goods companies could 
unlock a substantial opportunity by 
removing barriers to physical activity 
for more sedentary consumers.

has launched two pilot programs in the 
United Kingdom to teach children to swim. 
One offers intensive swim lessons in local 
pools, and the other provides lessons in 
pop-up pools brought to schools. The 
school-based program had 742 students 
participate in three weeks, and 36 percent 
of children who couldn’t swim before the 
program were able to swim 25 meters 
upon completion.33 

Shimano is collaborating with school 
bicycle clubs to teach children how to 
ride bikes, raise awareness about cycling, 
and spread this awareness to extended 
families through the children. The 
company provides bicycles for training 
sessions, spare parts, tools for repair 
and maintenance, and helmets. The 
Pedalanka Bicycle School collaboration 
in Izmir, Turkey, trained more than 3,200 
people over the past three years.34 

The sporting goods industry is well 
positioned to play its part in transforming 
global physical activity. It has in-depth 
knowledge of consumer behaviors, 

wields powerful influence across 
many sections of society, commits 
significant investment, and, perhaps 
most important, has a direct incentive to 
foster a more active population. In June 
2024, private sector sporting goods 
and fitness industries came together to 
sign a joint statement calling for urgent, 
coordinated action to address the 
growing physical inactivity crisis. The 
statement was signed by leading sporting 
goods players and members of WFSGI as 
well as other sporting goods, retail, and 
health and fitness federations. WFSGI 
continues to play an important role in 
aligning the sporting goods industry to 
tackle physical inactivity.35 The industry 
is already taking the lead on this issue, 
using its global platform and powerful 
collective voice to raise awareness—for 
example, at the World Economic Forum’s 
Annual Meeting in Davos.

But the challenge is too large for the 
industry to tackle alone. Increasing 
physical activity will require governments, 
educational institutions, employers, 
and healthcare professionals to further 
step up with significant intersectoral 
collaboration.

Over the past 25 years, we’ve moved

new phase, where they need to think 
about fighting commoditization—or 
rather, how to position against it. 
Meanwhile, consumers are reassessing 
their discretionary spending. People 
have a lot of choices, so companies have 
to deliver products that consumers want 
and that are the best quality.

The market’s growth and composition are

combination of those two things in our 
own way. We believe we command a 
price premium because our products are 
better. At the same time, we represent 
an active lifestyle that is aspirational for 
many consumers. 

We could deconstruct our products and 
put them back together with the same 
attributes and utility, and we’re still 
creating an incremental willingness to 
pay among consumers. That’s driven by 
the brand. I think it’s the combination of 
honing our purpose and having a distinct 
point of view that elevates people. Making 
products that no other brand offers or 
has conceived of reinforces Lululemon’s 
promise. If more people come into the 

How are you balancing the pursuit of 
growth with profitability in times of 
cost inflation? 

Lululemon is at its best when it is on its

The future is created through growth, 
but you have to have an eye on margins. 
Stakeholders want both, so it’s about 
making trade-offs. On the first point, we 
are a growth-driven company. The market 
rewards growth, and we hire people who 
thrive in growth and are rewarded for it.

Yet we obviously value the bottom line.

connect with the customer on an 
emotional level—in part by promoting all 
the values, principles, and attributes that 
are wrapped up in products and what 
they enable consumers to do. It is not only 
about functionality and how one looks

Sporting Goods 2025

While physical inactivity has reached record levels 
around the world, there is also a consumer segment that 
is increasingly active. McKinsey’s latest survey of these 
active consumers in the sporting goods industry revealed 
an expanding gap in activity levels, with physically inactive 
and active cohorts drifting ever further apart.36 For those 
already engaged in activity, exercise has evolved from a 
casual pursuit into a linchpin of health regimens and a 
defining element of personal identity. This shift stretches 
beyond the decade-long athleisure trend, heralding a deeper 
transformation in which an active lifestyle has become a 
central touchstone for a growing share of consumers.

Key insights

1.  Widening activity gap: The gap between physically active and inactive people is growing. While 
31 percent of adults are inactive, one-third of those who are active are exercising more regularly 
than one year ago.

2.  Increasing cultural relevance of fitness as core identity: Health, wellness, and fitness have 

become integral to consumers’ lifestyles globally, with almost one in two active consumers and a 
significant portion of Gen Zers and millennials viewing fitness as their core identity.

3.  Growing number of ‘super active’ consumers: Active consumers are becoming more active, 

with one in four exercising six or seven times a week.

Executive priorities

1.  Enhance product design and marketing: Develop products that meet the emotional  

and functional needs of active consumers, emphasizing both technical benefits and life- 
style alignment.

2.  Foster brand–consumer connection: Create deep personal connections with consumers by 
aligning brand values with their active lifestyles and engaging with communities to build loyalty.

3.  Leverage ‘super active’ consumers as ambassadors: Develop targeted marketing campaigns 

and community-building initiatives that resonate with these consumers’ active lifestyles, 
encouraging them to promote products through their networks and social media platforms.

Interest in health and fitness has soared, 
elevating physical activity from a casual 
pursuit to a defining pillar of many 
active people’s daily lives and identities 
(Exhibit 6). Among active consumers who 
responded to the McKinsey Sporting 
Goods Report Consumer Survey,  
54 percent prioritize exercise and 51 
percent regard fitness and an active 
lifestyle as essential to their identity. 
Among Gen Zers and millennials, the 
numbers climb higher still: 55 percent say 
that an active lifestyle is fundamental to 
who they are, and 60 percent exercise 
to bolster their self-image. These 
results highlight the increasing cultural 

As TRX Chief Executive Officer Jack Daly 
observes, “Health, wellness, and fitness 
have become deeply ingrained in the 
culture—not only in the US but also across 
Europe and Asia, and it is emerging in the 
Middle East as well.” 

Growing number of ‘super 
active’ consumers

As a result of the increased emphasis on 
fitness, some consumers have adopted 
healthier routines with greater dedication. 
Our analysis reveals that already-active 
individuals are ramping up their efforts 
(Exhibit 7). Notably, 84 percent of active 

respondents are exercising as much as, 
or more than, they did 12 months ago, 
with one in three engaging in physical 
activity more frequently than a year ago. 
In addition, 59 percent of these active 
consumers work out at least three times 
per week, and one in four exercises nearly 
every day. More than a quarter of them 
adhere to a strict training schedule. This 
trend highlights that a rising number of 
consumers are “super active” individuals 
and underscores the significance of 
fitness in their daily lives.38 

Several factors are motivating people 
to be physically active, according to the 
McKinsey survey. Foremost is a desire 
to improve health and longevity, cited 
by 72 percent of respondents as the top

motivations, brands can forge 
propositions that resonate on a 
personal and emotional level.

McKinsey’s State of Fashion Report 2025 
highlighted that sportswear has grown 
more rapidly than non-luxury fashion 
around the world and could continue this 
trajectory.42 In 2025, it is expected to 
outpace the rest of the fashion market 
by two to three percentage points in 
Europe and the United States and five 
to six percentage points in China.43 
Several forces are fueling this surge: 
blurring boundaries between fashion and 
activewear, rising health consciousness 
across every age group, and broader 
access to sports-related media and events.

Two-thirds of millennial and Gen Z 
consumers wear athleisure multiple 
times per week.44 To ensure their active 
lifestyle identity is recognized, many 
consumers communicate it by posting 
on social media. In fact, nearly one-fifth 
of consumers reported that they engage 
in sports and then share their activities 
online.45 Tapping into these “super active” 
consumers as brand ambassadors can 

be a powerful strategy for sporting 
goods brands. This strategy consists of 
developing targeted marketing campaigns 
and community-building initiatives 
that resonate with active lifestyles and 
encouraging consumers to promote 
products through their networks and 
social media platforms. 

Establishing an emotional 
connection with consumers

Sport as an identity now stands as a 
lifestyle in its own right, heralding a 
significant shift in consumer behavior. 
This trend offers sporting goods brands 
an opportunity to become indispensable 
to their consumers’ daily lives—but it 
demands a fresh perspective.

Consumers, particularly those who 
embrace an active self-image, increasingly 
wear sports apparel and footwear in 
everyday settings. To seize this moment, 
sporting goods makers must cultivate 

a nuanced grasp of the emotional and 
functional requirements of their target 
market, using these insights to refine 
product design and marketing while 
preserving the unique technical qualities 
that define their brand. By tapping into 
deeper consumer motivations, brands 
can forge propositions that resonate on a 
personal and emotional level.

Equally important are the emotional 
dimensions that appeal to niche segments. 
Here, brands seek to establish an intimate 
connection, presenting themselves as a 
mirror for the customer’s values and way 
of life. Building and engaging communities 
can strengthen this sense of belonging, 
while consistently aligning brand values 
with those of consumers fosters long- 
term loyalty.

Sporting Goods 2025The sports car of road cycling

Nicola Rosin, CEO, Colnago

Looking back at 2024, what are your 
main takeaways?

What has been the result of staying 
true to the core of your business?

From Colnago’s perspective, it was 
amazing. Almost four years ago, we 
decided to strategically focus on our 
strengths of our heritage and identity 
instead of trying to be everything in 
the bicycle industry. We kept our focus 
specifically on road bikes and the 
growing segment of gravel bikes. Being 
attentive and dedicated to a specific 
group of consumers is coherent with our 
story and allows us to put all our efforts  
in one basket. At the end of the day, it 
pays off. 

More generally, however, the cycling 
market and the sports market are clearly 
suffering. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has been tough on companies. I had 
predicted that the industry would be 
out of this negative cycle sooner, but 
that hasn’t been the case. Consumers 
are more conscious about what they’re 
buying. A lot of families now have 
financial issues that they didn’t have a 
few years ago. Despite these challenges, 
many companies are still trying to be 
everything for every consumer instead 
of focusing on their strengths. My 
suggestion is that companies return to 
the core of their business to realign with 
what their customer really wants.

At the end of 2020, Colnago was acquired 
by an investment fund from Abu Dhabi. 
We had many opportunities to distinguish 
ourselves from big market players, which 
offer products and services at all price 
points. We decided to focus on high-end 
drop bar bikes. We wanted to be number 
one in this niche, and day by day, month by 
month, we started to see the results. Our 
consumers are more engaged because 
we are authentic to our brand. We are 
specialists in the road-cycling segment 
and its customer base. That’s the truth of 
our company, and our consumers respond 
positively to it. 

Sport is becoming an ever-increasing 
part of people’s identity. What’s  
your view on the consumer’s need for 
your brand?

People have become more fragmented 
and disconnected from each other 
because of influences such as social 
media and the pandemic. People don’t 
necessarily have a place to go for 
guidance and support anymore. They feel 
lost. They want help shaping their sense 
of identity and finding a community. I’ll 
give you an example. In Italy, we used 
to have playgrounds near the churches. 
Whether you went to church or not, you 

were allowed to go on this playground 
where you could talk, socialize, and play 
every kind of sport. However, like many 
other types of communities, this doesn’t 
exist anymore. So people must now find 
ways to fulfill this need for community 
and have started looking to brands and 
companies for guidance on their identity 
and lifestyle. Companies started to 
realize that their success lies in becoming 
that community. When our customers 
start connecting with each other, whether 
because they’re a road cyclist or just love 
the brand, they start using the brand to 
shape how they think about themselves. 
Brands such as Ferrari or Apple have 
understood and internalized this for 
a long time. Our story and community 
are very important because they give 
our consumers a sense of identity 
and purpose. We recognize we have a 
responsibility to supply much more than 
a product. 

Where are you looking for growth, and 
where do you think the broader cycling 
industry could find growth now?

An area of growth we focus on is how we 
can define Colnago as an exclusive brand 
rather than a high-end road brand. If you 
are exclusive and focused on your core 
business, you can extend beyond it. In 
our case, it looks like services such as 

‘ My suggestion is that companies return  
to the core of their business to realign 
with what their customer really wants.’

Nicola Rosin is the CEO of Colnago, a renowned Italian manufacturer of high-
end bicycles. He has been instrumental in positioning Colnago as a premium 
brand, and his vision is to make Colnago “the most desirable bicycle brand in 
the world.”

organizing and selling a very high-end 
cycling trip or creating a partnership 
to offer other exclusive products while 
staying within our specialization. We 
have an amazing opportunity to explore 
outside our core product because we are 
successful in a super-high-end market. 
We are the number one company selling 
bicycles for more than €15,000. 

Regarding the broader cycling business, 
there are big opportunities in the online 
space. We have consumers who are 
ready to buy a superpremium bicycle 
online. This shows me that with the right 
product, attitude, and presentation, 
online channels could be very interesting 
to pursue. 

The other opportunity is R&D on our core 
business. When we can focus on our 
strengths and create better products, the 
consumers will always be there, especially 
in sports, where a product can improve 
performance or comfort. People will go for 
products that really give them benefits: a 
more comfortable saddle or tire, a more 

aerodynamic frame. You can grow by 
focusing on creating better solutions for a 
very demanding sportive consumer.

When you look toward 2025, what are 
your concerns, and what gives you hope 
and inspires optimism?

I am concerned for Colnago and for 
the industry because of the ongoing 
macroeconomic and geopolitical climate. 
We are affected by these issues daily. 
You can be the best brand and CEO with 
the best bicycle in the world, but if your 
supply chains are compromised or you 
are facing some geopolitical issue, you’re 
going to struggle. I don’t know when 
it’s going to end, if ever, and that can be 
scary. We’re living in uncertain times, and 
that’s a big topic for CEOs in this era.

At the same time, I am very optimistic  
for my company because we achieved  
the dream that we had four years ago:  
to be one of the most desirable brands  
in cycling.

Sporting Goods 2025Market share 
upheaval with 
large incumbents 
being challenged 
to up their game

38

Sporting Goods 2025Competition between large 
incumbents and challenger 
brands will likely intensify 
and is currently benefiting 
competitors that are 
more sharply positioned.
These brands have been 
successful by implementing 
strategies to reach specific 
consumer segments. In 
this new landscape, the 
path to success likely 
lies in preserving their 
value proposition or 
developing a mindfully 
curated house of brands. 

Key insights

1.  Intensifying competition: The competition between historically large 
incumbents and smaller and challenger brands is intensifying as the 
latter outpace incumbents in revenue growth and rapidly gain market 
share. As a result, challenger brands captured three percentage 
points of the market from large incumbents between 2019 and 2024.

2.  Strategic focus: Smaller and challenger brands succeed by crafting 
sharp value propositions tailored to specific segments, leveraging 
visible innovation, and tapping into cultural marketing.

3.  Distribution and manufacturing advantage: The shift has been 
driven by factors such as easier access to distribution channels 
through strategic wholesale partnerships (vacated by the large 
incumbents) and a well-developed network of third-party 
manufacturers of smaller and challenger brands.

4.  Increasing investor interest: Investors are increasingly favoring 
up-and-coming sportswear brands, highlighting the need for 
incumbents to refresh their strategies to stay competitive.

Executive priorities

1.  Innovate and differentiate: Incumbents need to enhance their value 
propositions with visible innovations and emotional connections to 
resonate with niche markets and maintain competitiveness.

2.  Grow but keep authentic core: For smaller and challenger brands, 
it is important to maintain the growth trajectory by keeping their 
authentic core and focusing on their niche segments.

3.  Embrace multichannel strategies: Ensure a mix of direct-to-

consumer and wholesale strategies to expand reach and build brand 
credibility, following the successful models of smaller and challenger 
brands.

4.  Explore growth archetypes: Consider expanding into adjacent 
categories or adopting a house-of-brands model (for example, 
through acquisitions) to scale effectively while retaining brand 
identity and consumer loyalty.

Sporting Goods 2025The landscape has shifted—
substantially and rapidly 

Over the past decade, the sporting 
goods market has witnessed a 
proliferation of new entrants, including 
both general apparel players that have 
strategically expanded their portfolios 
to feature activewear and specialized 
players offering a tightly focused value 
proposition for segments such as 
running, yoga, cycling, or gym attire. This 
specialization has enabled challenger 
brands to tap more deeply into the identity 
of consumers who gravitate toward 

brands that feel more “for me” rather 
than “for anyone.” Coupled with declining 
barriers to entry, this specialization has 
fueled the rise of challenger brands. 

Factors including easier access to 
distribution (via both wholesale and 
direct-to-consumer channels), a 
mature ecosystem of third-party textile 
manufacturers, and abundant venture 
capital and private equity funding have 
enabled many fledgling players to scale 
rapidly. Consider On: Founded in 2010 and 
driven by R&D and innovation, On secured 
early investment, expanded through 

wholesale and a targeted retail strategy, 
went public in 2021, and was on track to 
surpass $2.53 billion in revenue by 2024.46 

In a telling sign of industry realignment, 
challenger brands have eclipsed large 
incumbents Adidas and Nike in revenue 
growth and hence market share gains.47  
From 2019 to 2024, publicly traded 
challenger brands expanded at a faster 
rate; the two large incumbents ceded 
three percentage points of market share 
to challenger brands during this period 
(Exhibit 9).48

Investors have taken note. In the past year, 
share prices of challenger brands and 
companies such as Amer Sports (parent 
company of Arc’teryx), On, and Deckers 
(parent company of Hoka) registered 
substantial gains (Exhibit 10). Such results 
highlight the need for incumbent brands to 
reconsider their strategies if they hope to 
stave off growing competition.

Private capital has also flocked to 
emerging names. An illustrative example is 
the $825 million investment led by General 
Atlantic and Stripes in Vuori, a California-
based challenger brand whose offerings 
bridge fitness and everyday wear. 
Founded in 2015, Vuori was valued at  
$5.5 billion in 2024.49

that may go unnoticed by everyday 
customers. Challenger brands, however, 
unveil eye-catching features that resonate 
with consumers and define products. 
Hoka touts its oversize midsoles, while 
On leverages its distinctive CloudTec 
soles and has expanded into 3D-printed 
footwear—tactics that spark consumer 
interest and sustain an air of innovation.

Tapping into cultural marketing. Alo Yoga 
and New Balance have turned to celebrity 
endorsements and cultural ties to elevate 
their brands, while Gymshark, Hoka, 
and Vuori nurture authenticity through 
grassroots marketing and community 
building. Such moves can attract new 
consumer segments and underscore 
values such as well-being.

Exploring the recent success 
of challenger brands 

How have newer brands managed to 
expand their market share so rapidly? At a 
high level, they have focused on pursuing 
specific pockets of growth and expanding 
their reach in several ways.50

Crafting a sharper value proposition. 
Large incumbents cast a wide net, 
hoping to maintain a strong presence 
across multiple sports. By contrast, 
challengers focus on specific segments 
and overlooked demographics to build 
a sharp value proposition. Lululemon 
started its journey in women’s athletic 
wear and has successfully expanded 
from there. Arc’teryx has concentrated on 
outdoor enthusiasts, offering functionality 
and positioning its brand as the go-to 
choice for high-performance, durable 
gear tailored to extreme conditions and 
adventurous pursuits. The company’s 
offerings come with an emotional payoff 
for consumers who see activewear as a 
vehicle for self-expression. In these “cool” 
segments, shoppers often pay a premium 
for brands that reflect their identity.

rely on incremental performance gains

Harnessing wholesale and selective 
retail. When Adidas and Nike pivoted 
toward direct-to-consumer channels in 
the late 2010s, challengers stepped into 
the vacuum.51 They adopted wholesale-
first strategies, teaming up with specialist 
retailers to gain credibility and expand 
their footprint. Once these emerging 
players reach critical mass, they are often 
well positioned to experiment with their 
own flagship stores in prime locations, 
further reinforcing brand identity.

Two potential archetypes 
to achieve scale

Sporting goods brands with sharp value 
propositions and strong emotional 
connections have proliferated. This 
dynamic raises a dilemma for ambitious 
brands: How can they continue their 
growth journey and increase their market 
share while retaining the attributes that 
distinguished them in the marketplace? 

Future large incumbents will likely fall 
into one of these two archetypes: an 
overarching, stand-alone brand emerging 
from a successful growth recipe, or a 
mindfully curated house of brands. 

New incumbent stand-alone brands

Brands that excel in a particular category 
often seek to capitalize on their success 
by branching into adjacent product lines,

Sporting Goods 2025Forever a challenger

Samuel Wenger, COO, On

What surprised you most about the 
market in 2024? What aspects did you 
find to be the most challenging?

Overall, the sporting goods market had 
a surprisingly good year. We headed into 
2024 with some uncertainties, but the 
spending and interest in sport stayed 
high, especially in the premium sporting 
goods industry that we operate in. People 
are willing to spend on high-quality 
sports products—maybe even more so 
than before. 

On is present in some of the largest 
sporting goods markets: running and 
sportswear. How do you think about 
growth as a challenger to some of the 
biggest incumbents? 

The sportswear market is one of the 
largest markets you can play in, and 
running as a participation sport is the 
largest single-sport market out there. 
Both markets are experiencing healthy 
growth, and On is perfectly positioned 
to capitalize on this momentum. Our 
innovative product pipeline, with 
performance at its core, sets us apart. 
Additionally, we’ve managed to not only 
lead through performance technology 
but also combine it with a unique design 
and sustainability, which resonate very 
well with consumers. This allows us to 
also focus on the trends of infusing sports 
into lifestyles and people being more 
health-conscious in general and bringing 
sportswear into everyday life. 

As a challenger brand, On has not only 
captured a significant portion of the 
overall market growth—we’ve also gained 
market share from established players. 
You see, the running shoe industry had 
stagnated when it comes to innovation 
prior to our arrival in 2010. Consumers 
were craving something new, and we 

44

‘ If you have a core of 
innovation and the underlying 
technologies, you will always 
have a reason to exist.’

were ready to shake things up. We 
differentiated ourselves through our 
revolutionary CloudTec technology and 
through credible product adoption and 
storytelling that made our brand relatable 
for the everyday consumer and not only 
for the high-performance race segment. 
That combination led to fast growth.

Our ultimate goal is to inspire people 
to move, so we try not to get caught up 
in comparisons with our competitors. 
Instead, we focus on telling our own story 
and sharing our beliefs authentically. I 
trust that by staying true to our DNA, we’ll 
continue to unlock new opportunities and 
pathways to growth. 

How do you guard against disruption 
from small, nimble actors that are 
entering the market—not dissimilar to 
almost 15 years ago? 

Being a challenger and an innovator 
is deeply ingrained in On’s identity. 
For us, performance needs to come 
from innovation. And we see endless 
opportunities to innovate, not just in 
running shoe technology but also in 
the materials we use, our sustainability 
initiatives, our efforts toward circularity, 
and our apparel. We foster a culture of 
innovation and excellence throughout 
On. So innovation needs to come from 
everywhere, and our teams need to be 
adaptable to make quick decisions, make 

quick moves, and quickly go to markets 
so we can bring that innovation to the 
consumer swiftly.

Of course, trends will always come and 
go, but we never want to rely on the 
zeitgeist of what is in and out of fashion 
now. If you have a core of innovation and 
the underlying technologies, you will 
always have a reason to exist.

Ten years ago, the athleisure 
movement blurred the lines between 
sport and everyday apparel. How  
has On seen its customers change  
how they connect with the brand and 
their identity? 

Looking back at the post-COVID-19 
landscape, we saw the public’s growing 
health consciousness and desire to 
move. The pandemic really highlighted 
the importance of movement, both for 
our physical and mental health. We saw 
a surge of people embracing outdoor 
activities and finding new ways to stay 
active. Now, we see the next level of 
manifestation with active lifestyle 
becoming a part of people’s identity, which 
they express in daily life and daily wear.

At On, we’re passionate about showing 
our customers how their sport can be 
brought into everyday life. By exploring 
a wider range of activities beyond just 
running or tennis, we can connect with a 

Sporting Goods 2025broader audience that might be less aware 
that movement comes in many forms.

At On, you’re growing not only 
geographically but also in terms of 
category and customer appeal. How do 
you expand while staying true to your 
core values and the identity you’ve built?

On has always been deeply rooted in 
performance. Our mission—to ignite 
the human spirit through movement—
guides everything we do. We strive to 
be the leading premium performance 
sportswear brand, built on innovation, 
design, and sustainability. This drives  
our expansion. 

As we expand into new areas, such 
as tennis, weight training, and other 
forms of movement, our approach 
remains consistent. We first build the 
best-performing, pinnacle gear for 
our athletes, then from there create 
products more suited to everyday sports 
and lifestyles. This process allows 
us to achieve a level of authenticity 
that resonates with consumers. By 
collaborating with top athletes and 
cultural influencers, we build credibility 
and trust. This authentic connection is 
something we deeply value and prioritize 
in everything we do.

How does On connect with  
its customers?

A big part of our mission is raising 
awareness. Many people are inactive, 
either because they’re unaware of the 
benefits of movement or they feel too 
intimidated to get started. We believe 
in breaking down those barriers by 
providing education and access.

Take running, for example. We’ve 
seen a massive movement of people 
embracing run clubs and identifying with 
running culture. Running has become 
an expression of their lifestyle. We’ve 
hosted Clubhouse Nights that hundreds 
of people attend, and they leave with 
new styles that they integrate into their 
everyday lives. 

The most important thing is that people 
can relate to something—that’s where 
the power comes from. People need 
to connect with what we’re doing. 
Our collaborations with celebrities 
and professional athletes have been 
incredibly successful in this regard. When 
you have athletes or cultural influencers 
credibly or almost organically adopting 
On products and you’re able to tell 
the story of the people using them, it 
builds trust and strengthens our brand 
narrative. It goes beyond just the product 
itself; it’s about connecting with our 
mission and values.

While some consumers prioritize pure 
performance metrics, especially for our 
high-performance gear, many are drawn 
to the On brand and what it represents. 
For many consumers, the more important 
consideration is the brand, what it stands 
for, and how they relate to it. They might 
feel more inclined to adopt the everyday 
product over the pinnacle race product. 

Looking at the market ahead, what 
makes you optimistic, and what could 
be potential challenges?

While there’s always some uncertainty 
about the future, especially heading into 
2025, we’re incredibly confident in our 
direction. The increased desire of people 

‘ We’re incredibly confident

to move and the willingness to pay for 
premium products are enduring trends. 
As long as people want to move, we’ll be 
there to support them with innovative 
products and inspiring experiences.

When we look to 2025, we’re coming out 
of the past couple of years feeling quite 
positive and reinforced in the belief that 
our mission to ignite the human spirit 
through movement will always be there. 

There will inevitably be some disruption, 
but we’ve learned to live with it and be 
nimble and even turn it into an advantage. 
We also have very strong relationships 
with our partners—they want to make us 
successful, too. We’re confident in the 
consumer and in those strengths.

Sporting Goods 2025Boom of live sports  

and blurring lines  

with entertainment

The years following the height of the pandemic 
have seen a rise in the popularity of live, in-person 
activities. Some sports are enjoying greater levels 
of popularity than ever before. This dynamic 
presents opportunities for sporting goods 
companies to reassess their business models, 
marketing strategies, and customer outreach. 

Key insights

1.  Resurgence of in-person fitness and events: In-person fitness 
classes are highly popular; 81 percent of consumers participate, 
driven by motivation, group energy, and community connection. 
Additionally, the popularity of sports events has increased, with 
significant growth in attendance and engagement. The global 
ticketing market for live events surpassed $100 billion in 2023  
and is estimated to reach $150 billion by 2030.

2.  Blending sports and entertainment: The demand for live 
experiences is blurring the lines among sports, retail, and 
entertainment, creating new opportunities for brand engagement  
and loyalty.

3.  Strategic partnerships and events: Sporting goods brands are 
leveraging community events, mixed-use stadiums, and high-
experience-value events to enhance brand visibility and consumer 
engagement.

Executive priorities

1.  Enhance in-person and digital offerings: Develop a balanced 

approach to cater to both in-person and remote fitness audiences, 
maximizing growth opportunities by blending live and digital 
experiences. For example, enhance digital events through virtual 
reality to create customized, live-like experiences in the future.

2.  Leverage community and live events: Invest in community- 

driven events and partnerships with fitness studios, gyms, and 
sports clubs to create unique, engaging experiences that  
foster brand loyalty.

3.  Innovate retail spaces: Transform retail spaces into experiential 
hubs that host events. Blend sports, entertainment, and retail to 
attract and engage consumers, driving foot traffic and sales.

47

Sporting Goods 2025Resurgence of in-person 
fitness and events

Consumers have flocked to in-person 
fitness options. The McKinsey Sporting 
Goods Report Consumer Survey found 
that 81 percent of respondents attended 
in-person fitness classes in the past 
year—nearly two and a half times as many 
as those who used online fitness classes.52 
Fitness consumers reported increasing 
their spending on boutique studio classes 
and fitness club memberships in the 
past 12 months, a trend that is poised to 
continue in the next year and beyond.53 
Boutique studio classes particularly 
benefited from this trend; almost one in two 
consumers spent more in the past year, and 
one in three consumers plans to continue 
spending more, indicating an even higher 
demand in the future.54

Consumers choose in-person fitness 
classes primarily to boost their motivation 
and consistency: 65 percent of 

respondents cited the draw of exercising 
around others, and 40 percent reported 
liking the group atmosphere and energy. 
Slightly more than one-third found 
in-person classes to be more challenging 
than training alone.55

However, many consumers are also 
looking to fitness for connection with 
others: Approximately one-quarter 
of consumers participated in group 
fitness classes to increase their sense of 
community or belonging and to meet  
new people.56

The interest in connecting with a like-
minded community explains the rapid 
rise in social exercise clubs. Brands have 
started to capitalize on this trend to 
boost awareness of their products and 
promote innovations. For instance, On 
holds weekly run clubs that are free to the 
public at more than ten flagship locations 
around the world, giving participants the 
opportunity to test shoes. Nike is opening

a network of studios offering three types 
of group fitness experiences—functional 
strength and conditioning, running, and 
weightlifting—supported and enhanced 
with connectivity through its Studios app. 

How will the demand for in-person 
versus remote fitness evolve? In an 
interview for this report, TRX CEO Jack 
Daly said he expects consumers to 
maintain their preference for in-person 
workouts while the convenience of 
remote fitness will keep digital solutions 
relevant. Sporting goods players need 
to cater to both audiences to maximize 
their growth opportunities.

Blurring boundaries among 
sports, retail, and entertainment

The isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic 
led to pent-up demand for live events, 
and the past two years have seen a 
persistent surge in attendance. According 
to McKinsey estimates, the ticketing 
market for global live events surpassed 
$100 billion in 2023 and could reach $150 
billion by 2030 (Exhibit 11). Sporting events 
account for about half of this total and 
enjoy growing popularity. For instance, the 
Union of European Football Associations 
(UEFA) reports that in-person attendance 
at European football matches in the 
2023–24 season reached approximately 
221 million people—a 7 percent jump over 
the previous season.57 

As a result of this demand for live 
experiences, more venues are blending 
sports, entertainment, and retail. 

Retail spaces as venues for  
community events 
Sporting goods brands are pursuing 
innovative approaches to cater to the 
thirst for live, unique experiences. For 
instance, Adidas has experimented with 
pop-up stores and dedicated events at 
flagship locations, airports, and fan zones 
(areas near sports stadiums), to promote 
hyperlocal products. These initiatives 
not only create exclusive experiences for 
consumers through selective campaign 
extensions at local physical events but also

results are notable: 50 percent of Adidas 
customers say they feel more loyal to the

these events as an opportunity to increase 
foot traffic and attract new visitors as well as 
generate extra buzz on social media. 

Mixed-use stadiums to attract a 
broader audience beyond sports fans 
New stadiums are being designed as 
multipurpose complexes, creating vibrant 
hubs around stadiums by blending live 

sports, entertainment, and retail. These 
venues generate additional revenue 
streams by hosting both sporting and 
entertainment events on a year-round 
basis. Increasingly, the plans for sports 
venues include space for retail, dining, 
and entertainment. These facilities are 
also becoming more digitalized, creating 
an attractive experience that increases 
the amount of time visitors spend on their 
premises (on game days and off days), 
enhances community engagement, and 
boosts local economies.

designed as multipurpose 
complexes, creating vibrant 
hubs around stadiums 
by blending live sports, 
entertainment, and retail. 
These venues generate 
additional revenue streams 
by hosting both sporting 
and entertainment events 
on a year-round basis.

Notable examples show the wide range of 
opportunities to meet consumer demand 
for experiences. The Tottenham Hotspur 
Stadium in London, which opened in 2019 
and was built for £1 billion, is a state-of-
the-art facility that hosts various sporting 
events as well as concerts, corporate 
events, parties, and other large-scale 
events.59 Similarly, the redevelopment of the 
former Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo is a $5.8 
billion project that spans 20 hectares.60 The 
future complex will include a stadium to host 
sports competitions, live events, and trade 
shows, serving as a major hub combining 
commerce, leisure attractions, hospitality 
properties, and transport. 

New sports formats featuring 
competition and spectacle 
Amping up the entertainment factor in 
traditional sports leagues has broadened 
the appeal and audience for such 
offerings. For instance, the Kings League 
in Spain and the Baller League in Germany 
play new formats of football that combine 
traditional games with new rules (such 
as six players a side). In 2024, the Kings 
League and Baller League reached 
1.4 million and 207,000 peak viewers, 
respectively.61 Sporting goods brands such 
as Adidas have been early supporters and 
sponsors as these formats succeed in 
reaching new audiences.

and the sports community.64 

To build on this success, companies can 
develop a balanced approach to cater to 
both in-person and remote audiences, 
maximizing growth opportunities by 
blending live and digital experiences. 
Enhancing digital offerings through virtual 
reality can create customized, live-like 
experiences in the future.

The success of television shows about 
sports, such as Netflix’s Drive to Survive 
for Formula 1 and Tour de France: 
Unchained for cycling, highlights the 
growing preference for entertainment-
focused sports content. These shows offer 
a dramatized, behind-the-scenes look at 
the sports, making them more accessible 
and engaging to a broader audience. 
Drive to Survive has significantly boosted 
Formula 1’s popularity in the United 
States, attracting new viewers and helping 
expand viewership to nearly 30 million 
across ESPN platforms during the 2024 
Formula 1 World Championship season.62 

Harnessing the power of 
live experiences to enhance 
in-person and digital 
offerings 

The resurgence of in-person fitness, 
driven by the desire for motivation, 
accountability, and social connection, 
is reshaping the fitness landscape. As 
consumers increasingly seek community-
oriented fitness experiences with an 
entertainment angle, brands that can 
effectively combine in-person and digital 
offerings will be well positioned to thrive.

Blending sports and entertainment 
through live events has proved a 

lucrative strategy even for brands in 
industries outside sporting goods. In 
2012, Red Bull produced the Stratos 
event, which involved Austrian skydiver 
Felix Baumgartner free-falling from 
the stratosphere, breaking the sound 
barrier in the process.63 The company 
has established a niche that not 
only reinforces its brand identity but 
also generates substantial revenue 
through sponsorship and advertising, 
merchandising, and content monetization 
(for example, revenues from YouTube, 
documentary sales, and TV streaming). 
This strategy continues to be successful 
to this day.

Sporting goods players can follow this 
example by partnering with other players 
or operating their own live events. For 
instance, Puma, Red Bull, and Weltklasse 
Zürich collaborated to host an event 
featuring a head-to-head 100-meter 
race between track-and-field champions 
Mondo Dupliants and Karsten Warholm. 
This event demonstrated how to captivate 
audiences and elevate brand partnerships. 
By bringing together two iconic athletes 
from different disciplines, the event not 
only showcased the athletes’ talents but 
also attracted global attention, providing a 
unique platform for Puma and its partners

Ready to play? Decathlon is!

Celine Del Genes, global chief 
customer officer, Decathlon

What were the main trends and 
challenges you saw in 2024? 

Several developments stand out. The 
first was the success of sport in terms 
of engagement with fans. The Olympics 
had a huge impact across Europe, 
in part because our society needs 
uplifted. The Games were a positive 
confirmation of the power of sport. 
Second, the geopolitical situation we 
live in is extremely complex, and that 
has an effect all along the value chain—
production, transportation, freight, and 
consumption. The third development is 
climate change. Its trajectory is having a 
greater effect on sporting goods. Winter 
sports, for example, are already suffering 
significantly. We have a robust plan 
to do our part, but the sporting goods 
companies need to determine what 
collective role we are going to play in 
addressing this challenge. 

Which markets and customer 
segments are you prioritizing for 
growth in 2025?

Decathlon is focused on mature and less-
mature markets alike. Each market brings 
its own dynamics. If you think about the 
Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, 
for example, sports are less federated, 
organized, and business-driven than in 

other regions. Those markets could be 
poised for growth, so we’re adapting our 
approach to meet those customers where 
they are in their journey.

We’ll achieve our twin goals of growth and 
profitability by continuing to modernize 
the experience across channels. Since we 
are a retailer and a brand, we will maintain 
a strong focus on stores while investing in 
innovation for products in key categories. 

Similarly, we’re mindful of tailoring our 
offerings to different segments. We are 
continuing to embrace more-specialized 
brands, which often target consumers 
with higher purchasing power. We are 
building brands such as Van Rysel and 
Kiprun that have been enjoying rising 
popularity in recent years. We’ll also 
market to consumers in the entry price 
point segment, who have felt increased 
pressure on their discretionary spending. 
We think the answer is to push for 
sustainability, circularity, repair, and 
subscription models. 

As a company, you have given yourself 
highly aspirational sustainability 
objectives. How has Decathlon 
incorporated sustainability into its 
strategy? 

It’s critical to find ways to embed 
sustainability and circularity into 

‘ We’ll achieve our twin goals 
of growth and profitability by 
continuing to modernize the 
experience across channels.’

our business. Sustainability has two 
primary components: reducing CO₂ 
and reassessing the business model. 
We take our role to protect nature very 
seriously. Even though we are a growing 
business, we are decreasing our CO₂ 
footprint by changing how we design and 
manufacture products. 

We are also investing in circularity. 
Customers can go to Decathlon and rent 
a bike for their child. That means that 
as the child grows, families don’t need 
to throw the bike away or keep it in the 
garage. Renting ensures the child always 
has the right bike. At the same time, 
those bikes are in continuous use, which 
is much better for nature. To support 
this offering, we’ve added ateliers in 
our stores to repair bikes and guide 
customers. 

We believe we’re shifting the industry’s 
perspective on sustainability, but it’s 
not easy logistically. We now provide 
wraparound services, such as repair and 
maintenance, and buy back items—all 
while ensuring consistent quality. Those 
elements are transforming the way we’re 
engaging with consumers.

In 2025, we aim to continue building 
out our circularity strategy, including 
expanding our repair and subscription 
offerings. We’ll also adapt our practices 
to address sustainability. It will be critical 
to bring customers with us on that 
journey—and value will be a key element 
of this strategy. Customers demand value 
and appreciate the link to sustainability, 
but it’s not value at all costs; that’s an 
important distinction. Products must 
deliver good value for money, but they 
can’t be cheap, because goods made in 
poor conditions have an impact on the 
world. Value and sustainability will be 
more and more intertwined. 

Sporting Goods 2025Celine Del Genes is the global chief customer officer at Decathlon, a global leader 
in sporting goods and active-lifestyle products. Celine is dedicated to enhancing 
customer experience and driving the company’s mission of making sports accessible 
to all, ensuring that every customer feels inspired and empowered to embrace an 
active life.

Last, we’ve always been anchored on 
the experience we create in our physical 
stores. A lot of customers know that if 
they come with their family, their kids can 
play in our stores. We don’t stop people 
from shooting a ball in the store. That’s 
what sport is about—trying, testing, and 
having fun.

Our teammates play a key role: They 
are the pride of the company as well as 
a magnet for attracting people to our 
stores. When you come to a Decathlon 
store, you don’t speak to a salesperson; 
you speak to someone who’s passionate 
about their sport, just like you are. They 
know about the community. That’s the 
role our stores have to play in engaging 
with customers and creating a bond.

Do you see rising physical inactivity 
levels across the world as a threat, and 
how is Decathlon responding?

Physical activity is a key element in 
Decathlon’s engagement strategy. We 
launched Ready to Play? to make sports 
less intimidating and performance-
oriented. For us, sport is about the joy of 
physical activity. That’s a more inclusive 
sentiment for the masses than the elite; 
not everyone can be Messi or Ronaldo. 

The rise of newer sports—such as 
pickleball in the US and urban street 
sports such as skating—and the 
popularity of table tennis in the Olympic 
Games offer opportunities. They are 
more community-driven and accessible; 
it’s cheaper to do paddleball than tennis 
because you split the court with four 
people. Those lower barriers and the 
social aspect can draw new participants. 
We developed a product offering that 
lowers the cost barrier, making sports 
more accessible to everyone. Beyond 
that, we run programs worldwide to 
encourage people to explore sports or 
use them as a means to transform and 
enhance their lives. For example, the 
Vitalsport program enables families to 
try a variety of sports, serving nearly half 
a million people across more than 30 
countries.

I also believe the notion of health and 
wellness will continue to develop. The 
more stress you have from work or the 
geopolitical environment, the more you 
need to find an escape. And that escape, 

in my opinion, is twofold. One is health 
and wellness—yoga, Pilates, meditation, 
all those elements—and one is nature—
hiking, running, biking, and any activity 
people can do to enjoy the outdoors.  
I expect those types of activities to grow 
in popularity. 

Decathlon takes a distinctive approach 
to community engagement and live 
events. What are the ways you bring it 
to life? 

Our marketing, programming, and 
physical stores all play a part. In regard 
to marketing: For this year’s Olympic 
Games, we concentrated our involvement 
not on the athletes but on the volunteers 
to celebrate the ones who actually 
make the Games happen. I think that’s 
distinctive in the world of sport because 
no one paid that much attention to the 
volunteers before. We treated them like 
the heroes of the Games—because they 
are.

Second, we launched programs that 
seek to connect people with their local 
community. This approach came from 
the recognition that many people are 
settling for virtual experiences through 
their phones rather than interacting with 
the physical world. We already have an 
annual event called Vitalsport, which is all 
about discovery. It creates a link between 
local sport organizations, our stores, 
and customers. Bringing those elements 
together supports community building 
and engagement.
