Global Insurance 
Report 2025: The 
pursuit of growth

Finding profitable growth is an imperative for the 
world’s personal and commercial property and 
casualty insurers, while life carriers must adjust to 
changing consumer needs.

For an industry focused on mitigating risk and providing protection, the world’s insurers are enduring a 
particularly volatile age. The macroeconomic picture is mixed, with inflation stubbornly high and interest 
rates uncertain. Consumer confidence remains shaky, even though the economic growth cycle appears to 
have bottomed out. Geopolitical instability remains a perceived threat to global growth, and trade patterns 
are shifting amid signs of protectionism.

Yet McKinsey’s Global Insurance Report 2025—published in three chapters covering personal lines P&C, 
commercial P&C, and life—finds significant ground for optimism. In offering granular insights and clear 
recommendations for how leading insurers can drive performance, the reports identify opportunities for 
capturing profitable growth as they navigate this shifting landscape.

Personal P&C: Opportunities amid challenges

While personal lines (P&C) insurance premiums grew by 9.5 percent in 2022–23 to $1.1 trillion—outpacing 
nominal global GDP by half a percentage point1—gross written premiums as a share of nominal GDP 
remained below prepandemic levels and the coverage gap between mature and emerging economies 
widened. Industry growth in developed markets was largely driven by rate increases, indicating limited 
expansion into new risks, while insurance affordability emerged as a significant topic in some markets 
including the United States because of rising underlying asset prices, the cost of repairs and frequency of 
damage (especially in areas exposed to physical risk), and rising reinsurance costs.

Amid these challenges, we see a chance for carriers to innovate, expand coverage, and increase the 
industry’s relevance. Several economies in Latin America and Asia are potential pockets of growth and may 
enter economic conditions that will enable greater insurance coverage and relevance. The aging global 
population and evolving customer purchasing patterns present opportunities for carriers to rethink their 
capabilities and offerings. Distribution is getting closer to the customer as players embed the purchase of 
insurance into broader purchases of goods and services. New mobility models will force carriers to rethink 
their approach to distribution, pricing, product design, and claims processing. Amid the continued rise 
of physical risk, carriers will need to invest in new capabilities to help manage, mitigate, and transfer the 
risk related to natural disasters. Last, evolving technology—particularly AI and generative AI—will enable 
carriers to rethink and innovate the end-to-end value chain.

currency fluctuations.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthCommercial P&C: Finding growth beyond rate increases

Global commercial P&C insurance lines continued to deliver strong growth despite more recent evidence 
of softening conditions. Premiums increased by an average of 8 percent annually in the past five years, 
while the average combined ratio for the industry trended downward to an estimated 91 percent in 2023.2 
Almost all of this growth was driven by higher premiums, and insurers must now focus on how they capture 
consistent, profitable growth amid the shifting market landscape. 

Although where insurers operate is important, the majority of their financial performance is driven by how 
they operate. This dynamic applies across both soft- and hard-cycle years and applies generally, although 
factors such as regional differences may lead to exceptions.3 While effective portfolio strategy should not 
be disregarded, execution matters even more, and insurers should double down on their capabilities in their 
core lines of business to achieve profitable growth. 

Life: Embracing a changing landscape
It has been a year of unpredictable mixed signals, uncertainty, and surprising upsides for the life and 
retirement insurance industry. While unexpectedly resilient macroeconomic conditions provided tailwinds—
global GDP growing in real terms,4 inflation steadily decreasing,5  and equity markets turning positive6—not 
all product lines and geographies benefited. And while there were bright spots, the industry overall is 
struggling for relevance.

Yet there are significant opportunities amid the challenges. The life insurance market is being reshaped 
by the aging global “silver” population of people aged 65 or older and the concentration of wealth among 
Generation X7 and retirees. And while changing social norms and ways of living—such as fewer marriages, 
lower fertility rates, and more dual-income households—are challenging the traditional life insurance model, 
it presents an opportunity for more flexible policies catering to nontraditional family structures.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthIntroduction

The personal lines property and casualty (P&C) industry writes about a quarter of the world’s insurance 
premiums. It protects people and their loved ones wherever they are, every day. Yet that means the 
disruption consumers have faced globally in recent years—from a global pandemic to rising costs, the 
increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, and the changing nature of how we live and work—is 
also shared by the industry. And that presents both challenges and opportunities.

While the growth of personal lines (P&C) insurance accelerated in 2023, the industry’s relevance—measured 
by gross written premiums as a share of nominal GDP—remained below prepandemic levels, and the coverage 
gap between mature and emerging economies widened. Industry growth in developed markets was driven 
largely driven by rate increases, indicating limited expansion into new risks. Additionally, insurance affordability 
has become a significantly relevant topic: the rising cost of home coverage outpaced income growth in select 
regions, including the United States. That is a function of underlying asset prices rising, increasing total 
insurable value; the cost of repairs and frequency of damage rising, especially in areas exposed to physical 
risk; and rising reinsurance costs. Because many regions are exposed to the same underlying drivers, rising 
premiums could expand to other regions.

However, these challenges also represent a chance for carriers to innovate, expand coverage, and increase 
the industry’s relevance. We are positive about the industry’s outlook as it pivots toward sustained, 
profitable growth. We see recent profitability challenges easing as inflation stabilizes and carriers in  
many regions reach rate adequacy, while net investment income continue to rise, supported by higher 
interest rates.

That is not to suggest the big trends disrupting the industry will disappear; they may even intensify. Mobility 
trends—from electric vehicles to the promise of autonomous vehicles (AVs)—are changing auto insurance 
and have the potential to disrupt the sector. Natural disasters are more frequent, severe, and volatile, 
and risks associated with them may expand the gap between what is protected and what is not. At the 
same time, several economies in Latin America and Asia are potential pockets of growth because their 
macroeconomic indicators are at (or are approaching) the point where insurance coverage can leapfrog, 
given the right tailwinds. The aging global population and evolving customer purchasing patterns present 
opportunities for carriers to rethink their capabilities and offerings, while evolving technology—particularly 
AI and generative AI (gen AI)—and distribution can be used to further spur innovation.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growth1

The personal lines P&C 
industry opportunity

Personal P&C insurance represented about $1.1 trillion in gross written premiums in 2023, about a quarter 
of the insurance industry’s total premiums.1 Premium growth of 9.5 percent in 2022–23 outpaced nominal 
global GDP by half a percentage point,2 marking a reversal from the period from 2019 to 2022, when 
premiums grew by 3.2 percent per year and lagged behind GDP by 13 percentage points over three years. 
This expansion was mainly driven by carriers pushing for rate adequacy after high inflation and accelerated 
loss trends between 2021 and 2023.

Yet, even with growth in 2023, the relevance3 of personal lines has not yet returned to prepandemic levels: 
personal lines represented 1.0 percent of global GDP, compared with 1.2 percent in 2019. In addition, auto 
and home insurance accounted for more than 93 percent of premium growth in 2023 (compared with 
88 percent in the period from 2019 to 2022), highlighting limited expansion into new risks. Simultaneously, 
the gap between mature and emerging economies has widened. While in mature markets personal lines 
premiums remained at 1.5 percent of GDP between 2019 and 2023, in emerging economies, that same 
share fell from 0.7 percent in 2019 to 0.5 percent in 2023, suggesting a widening gap in risk coverage.

Rising relevance in both mature and emerging markets represents an opportunity for carriers as they pivot 
to focus on profitable growth. We are positive about the industry’s outlook: premiums in the United States, 
for example, are expected to grow by 11 percent annually through 2025 as combined ratios decrease by 
more than eight percentage points.4

Even with growth in 2023, the relevance 
of personal lines has not yet returned 
to prepandemic levels: personal lines 
represented 1.0 percent of global GDP, 
compared with 1.2 percent in 2019.

currency fluctuations.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthGrowth has been fueled by rate increases, with limited expansion into new risks
North America, the world’s biggest personal lines market, experienced the most growth in 2023, 
expanding by 14 percent and outpacing nominal GDP growth by about eight percentage points. Premium 
growth was largely driven by rate increases (for example, rates in the US auto market jumped 16 percent 
compared to premium growth of 11 percent), reflecting carriers’ attempts to restore premium adequacy 
after several years of challenged profitability due to increased claims costs. This indicates that covered 
exposures likely contracted. 

Rate increases also drove premium growth in other mature markets such as developed Asia and Western 
Europe.5 Examples include the growth of auto and home rates by 25 and 13 percent, respectively, in the 
United Kingdom; by 5 and 15 percent, respectively, in Italy; and by nearly 13 percent for both in Australia. 
Thus, consistent with North America, many other mature markets did not expand coverage to new 
customers or new risks.

In emerging economies across Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa, 
personal lines market growth in the 2022–23 period lagged behind GDP by five percentage points, and 
average 2023 relevance remained below 0.5 percent of GDP—just a third of the 1.5 percent in developed 
economies. Some markets experienced growth in relevance, though: premiums in Malaysia, South Africa, 
and Thailand outpaced GDP growth by more than two percentage points. Similarly, in Mexico and Chile, for 
example, auto premiums grew faster than rates by more than 12 percentage points in 2023.

Finally, growth in product lines diverged. In mature markets, growth was primarily fueled by auto and home. 
Yet accident and liabilities grew faster than auto and home in some regions, such as accident in Latin 
America and liabilities in emerging Asia (Exhibit 1).

In emerging economies across Asia, 
Eastern Europe, Latin America, 
and the Middle East and Africa, 
personal lines market growth in 
the 2022–23 period lagged behind 
GDP by five percentage points.

Combined ratios deteriorated for most of the industry in the 2022–23 period due to inflation coupled 
with delays in achieving rate adequacy.6 Nonetheless, combined ratios in 2024 are recovering as inflation 
normalizes and rate increases take hold, pivoting the industry toward profitable, sustainable growth.

Profitability challenges were acute across markets as inflation increased. Net combined ratios grew 
between 2021 and 2023, most notably in the United Kingdom (where combined ratios7 and inflation 
increased by 16 percentage points and 17 percent, respectively), the United States (five percentage points 
and 12 percent, respectively), and Australia (three percentage points and 13 percent, respectively). 

With inflation slowing through 2023, profitability has shown a more promising trajectory. The average loss 
ratio in the United States in the first half of 2024 was 11 percentage points lower than in the comparable 
period a year earlier. Capital markets appear to expect this improvement to sustain, as suggested by 
personal lines’ stock prices outperforming the broader S&P 500 in the first half of 2024.8

Insurance affordability: Rising coverage costs may become more widespread
While insurance cost in many markets have been stable for the past four years when measured by average 
premium per policy relative to disposable household income (Exhibit 2), headline rate increases have made 
insurance feel more expensive for many consumers—especially in the context of price increases for other 
essentials. And, in some markets, the perception that insurance costs have increased faster than incomes 
reflects reality: the cost of US home insurance grew from 1.0 percent of household income in 2019 to 
1.2 percent in 2023, for example, while a 0.1-percentage-point increase also occurred in Australia home 
insurance.

Three related effects are driving up the cost of coverage in these markets:

 — Underlying asset prices have risen and increased total insurable value. Median home prices in the 

United States have increased by 35 percent since 2019, for example, driving up total insurable value 
while household incomes remained relatively flat. Similarly, housing prices in Australia have increased 
35 percent since 2019.9

 — Cost of repairs and frequency of damage have risen especially fast in areas increasingly exposed to 

physical risk. In Florida and California, for example, average home premiums per policy have increased 
by more than 31 percent since 2019, compared with a 17 percent increase across the United States. 
Correlatedly, these states experienced significant increases in physical risk, driven by natural disasters 
(more details in the following section).

 — Reinsurance costs have risen and terms and conditions have become stricter, making insuring risk 

more costly for carriers. This is exemplified by the 100 percent increase in US home reinsurance prices 
between 2018 and 2023, making it more expensive for carriers to offer coverage.

While we expect asset prices (and total insurable value) to normalize relative to income, climate change 
and resulting increases in physical risk will continue to pressure affordability in select markets. This has 
the potential to expand to other regions. The challenge for the industry is to find ways to continue offering 
affordable insurance.

geographic opportunities 
Auto insurance globally rewards scale, enabling top carriers within each market to capture the most 
growth and profits. That continued in most regions in the period from 2022 to 2023. The top five auto 
carriers in the United States captured 63 percent of premium growth and 72 percent of pretax income, 
for example, reaching about 55 percent market share. In Asia, Latin America, and most of Europe, the top 
five carriers have similarly captured the most growth and profits. Even in the few countries where smaller 
carriers captured a greater share of premium growth—such as Canada and France—the top five captured 
the greatest share of income (Exhibit 3). Yet opportunities for new and smaller carriers are emerging; as 
demographics, economics, distribution channels, and the mobility ecosystem evolve, new players and 
incumbents may find avenues for growth (for more, see chapter 2, “Trends affecting personal lines”). 

The homeowners insurance market is more fragmented in some economies. For example, in Germany, 
carriers outside the top ten captured 42 percent of premium growth and 32 percent of pretax income the 
past four years. In the United States, carriers outside the largest ten sustained market share of more than 
35 percent, although the largest five carriers captured more income.

While scale is certainly important when it comes to homeowners insurance, this market presents more 
opportunities for carriers to differentiate within a specific customer segment. Carriers large and small have 
been able to capture growth by innovating in risk coverage and focusing on specific geographies. Especially 
as climates change, smaller, focused carriers can continue to capture growth by way of the historical 
patterns of many home insurance perils, geographic-specific insights and expertise to underwrite home 
insurance, and the relationship-driven nature of the business.

Opportunities for new and smaller 
carriers are emerging; as demographics, 
economics, distribution channels, 
and the mobility ecosystem evolve, 
new players and incumbents 
may find avenues for growth.

Trends affecting 
personal lines

Emerging mobility models, the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, and other disruptions 
are forcing carriers to rethink their approach to providing coverage. Growing relevance in emerging markets 
and growing value pools to serve an aging population provide opportunities to capture new growth. Evolved 
distribution and artificial intelligence may also spur innovation, helping the industry shift toward sustained, 
profitable growth.

New mobility models will force carriers to rethink their approach
Innovation is changing both the vehicles on our roads and how they are driven. 

Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are already nearly universal, featured in most cars sold across 
the globe in 2023.10 Though the additional cost of these features increases average severity, ADAS enable 
carriers to develop new and more personalized methods of risk assessment and pricing (by using more 
data), to reduce claims frequency (by cocreating solutions with auto manufacturers to reduce accidents), 
and to innovate products (such as usage-based insurance).

In 2023, overall sales of electric vehicles (EVs) grew rapidly, jumping by 35 percent (to nearly 14 million 
units) globally in 2023 compared with 2022.11 This rapid growth has slowed in 2024. For example, the share 
of EVs in the United States shrank in Q1 2024 before recovering in the second and third quarters. The EU 
saw similar declines in the summer of 2024.12 Yet we expect EVs to mature and represent approximately 15 
percent of vehicles in operation globally in 2030 and 30 percent by 2035, with the largest growth in China, 
followed by Europe and the United States. This adoption may increase average claim size in the short term 
given that, in developed markets, components in EVs cost 70 percent more than those in conventional 
vehicles.13 

Partial automation in vehicles is also expanding: we expect vehicles equipped with initial and partial driving 
automation capabilities, in which drivers must be available to take the wheel, to represent approximately 
35 percent of vehicles in operation by 2030 and more than 50 percent by 2035.14

As the mix of vehicles on roads changes, so do people’s mobility preferences. The market sizes of shared 
transport (such as ride-hailing) and micromobility (such as e-bicycles) are expected to double by 2030 in 
developed economies, continuing to evolve risk pools as drivers, modes of transportation, and number of 
miles driven all shift.

We expect this evolution to have significant implications for the structure of personal auto insurance 
markets. We expect an increasing share of commercial lines as segments such as car sharing or ride hailing 
continue to grow and as consumers opt for flexible ownership models. We expect further disruption from 
EVs, which have different frequency and severity profiles. Last, the evolution of ADAS will also open up 
new opportunities regarding risk assessment and behavior modification. These trends will create a new

adaptations, provide additional data, decrease claims frequency while increasing severity, and evolve 
current distribution channels.

In addition, the line between commercial and personal insurance will blur as ride sharing and the use  
of AVs grow. Ride sharing transfers responsibility from individual drivers to professional organizations,  
and AVs will shift responsibility from humans to machines. Carriers traditionally insuring personal lines will 
face a challenge: expanding to commercial lines and underwriting larger organizations, OEMs, and  
system providers. 

Finally, at some point, premiums for conventional auto personal lines coverage may decline as fully 
automated vehicles are adopted. This timeline is unclear, given significant factors such as regulatory 
considerations, technical challenges, and user reluctance.

These shifts create both opportunities and imperatives for change. Actions carriers can take include 
forming partnerships with OEMs and EV providers to access a broader client base and data, innovating EV 
and AV risk assessment and coverage, and developing products and ecosystems specific to new vehicles.

We expect an increasing share 
of commercial lines as segments 
such as car sharing or ride hailing 
continue to grow and as consumers 
opt for flexible ownership models.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthInvesting in new capabilities that can help in managing natural disasters
Natural disasters and associated economic losses15 have significantly increased in the past two decades 
as climate patterns have shifted.16 Volatility from natural disasters has also increased: for instance, the 
standard deviation of economic losses nearly doubled in Europe and the Americas between the period from 
2000 to 2015 and the period from 2016 to 2023. Together, these shifts have made prediction and pricing 
increasingly difficult. 

Coverage of losses continues to be insufficient. From 2016 to 2023, nearly 70 percent of global losses from natural 
disasters were not insured, equaling up to about $260 billion in uninsured losses in a given year (Exhibit  4).17

clear the industry is not providing sufficient levels of risk transfer under current models.

Specific regions face acute challenges. For instance, the five-year average cost associated with billion-
dollar natural disasters increased in Florida from $1 billion in 200018 to nearly $26 billion in 2023, compared 
with a fivefold increase across the United States (from $24 billion to $123 billion).19 A similar increase in 
average losses from natural disasters—mainly floods—was observed in northern Italy,20 relative to the rest  
of the country. 

Risks from natural disasters will likely keep rising, increasing the protection gap. For instance, the first 
half of 2024 was the second costliest on record for insured losses from severe thunderstorms and was 
87 percent higher than the ten-year average.21 Increases of up to 20 percent in average annual losses are 
expected in the United States during the next decade, with the effect of natural disasters predicted to jump 
more than tenfold in specific counties (for example, some within Idaho, New York, and Washington).22

Across regions, the industry response is taking shape, including carriers and public–private models. Some 
carriers have increased underwriting sophistication by partnering with other players and improving data 
and analytics capabilities to understand risks more granularly. Some carriers have directly supported 
policyholders through risk-mitigating efforts (such as home walk-throughs and in-home monitoring devices 
to identify and reduce vulnerabilities), while others have adjusted products and tightened terms and 
conditions to reflect changing risks and affordability needs (such as by offering separate roof coverage).  
As a last resort, some carriers have refocused their geographic appetite. 

Additionally, countries are debating and experimenting with different public–private models to address the 
natural disaster challenge. In some countries, mandatory models have emerged—for example, government-
offered flood insurance is a requirement in France. In other countries, such as the United States, flood 
insurance is optional for owners without a mortgage. Carriers may look to tailor their approach to public–
private models depending on the country and business line in which they operate.

From 2016 to 2023, nearly 
70 percent of global losses from 
natural disasters were not insured, 
equaling up to about $260 billion of 
uninsured losses in a given year.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthSelect emerging markets are on the verge of expanding relevance, creating  
opportunities for granular growth
Personal lines’ relevance is correlated with GDP per capita: as countries develop and economics improve, 
customers are more willing and have greater means to purchase insurance, which creates opportunities to 
increase relevance. Markets with GDP per capita of less than $10,000 typically have relevance levels below 
0.5 percent, while mature markets with GDP per capita greater than $30,000 usually reach relevance levels 
above 1.0 percent. Countries with GDP per capita of $10,000 to $30,000 are in a potential “high growth” 
region—that is, they are poised for increases in relevance, driven by growth in GDP per capita (Exhibit 5).23

Notable countries in the high-growth zone that present opportunities for local and international carriers 
include Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, and Türkiye. Similarly, China is within the high-growth zone 
because its population makes it one of the largest personal lines markets (worth about $110 billion) and it 
has a growing GDP per capita.24

Other attractive opportunities consist of markets currently outside the high-growth zone but with rapidly 
accelerating GDP per capita. These include Colombia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where GDP per 
capita is expected to grow by 3 percent or more annually through 2033. While this alone may not push these 
economies into the high-growth zone, their timeline could rapidly accelerate through other evolving factors, 
such as growth in insurance education, population, and external investment.

It is important to note that, even if relevance remains constant, countries with large populations and rapid 
GDP growth also present growth opportunities. India has, for instance, the potential to be a major market, 
given favorable demographics and economics, higher literacy rates, and nearly $30 billion of yearly foreign 
direct investment.

Notable countries in the high-growth 
zone that present opportunities 
for local and international carriers 
include Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Poland, and Türkiye. 

23  Based on examples from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Other factors—such as political stability and level of 

bancarization—also affect market maturity and insurance’s relevance. Underlying data is from the US Census Bureau International Database

Two major demographic-related shifts present opportunities for innovation and growth.

First, the share of the world’s population aged 65 or older is projected to grow from 12 percent in 2023 to 15 
percent by 2033, reaching more than 20 percent in North America, Western Europe, developed Asia, and 
China (Exhibit 6).25 Older customers tend to present a different risk profile and insurance needs. For auto 
insurance, older customers tend to have lower accident frequency but higher accident severity and medical 
claim payouts (for instance, the fatality rate of older drivers in the United States is 1.5 to 4.0 times higher 
than that of younger drivers).26 Shifts in risk exposure as populations age present an opportunity for carriers 
to master product enhancements (for example, personal accident, in-home assistance, or multiyear policies, 
given the older population’s decreased use of cars and lower likelihood to switch homes), risk pricing and 
underwriting (such as advanced segmentation), and distribution to cater to the aging population.

The second shift relates to the purchasing habits of consumers. In mature markets, major purchases 
of homes and autos are occurring later in life: in Germany and the United States, for example, the age 
of first-time homebuyers has increased by about three years in the past decade. As consumers’ life 
journeys increasingly vary, carriers have an opportunity to evolve brand loyalty by providing a broad set of 
personalized solutions (through both proprietary channels and brokerage) across a customer’s lifetime—

insurance year over year; and finally, proposing home insurance to middle-aged consumers.

Similarly, select emerging markets present granular opportunities for carriers to grow and expand personal 
lines insurance beyond auto and home by tailoring it to specific needs. This growth is already under way: 
liability, accident, and other P&C insurance grew 11 percent, 9 percent, and 9 percent, respectively, in 
emerging markets between 2022 and 2023—compared with 4 percent growth in mature markets. A similar 
trend holds true within individual countries such as Egypt, India, and Mexico.

Distribution is changing to get closer to the customer as players embed the 
purchase of insurance into broader purchases of goods and services
Distribution channels keep evolving. New carriers and incumbents alike are leveraging customers’ trust, 
time, and proximity to sell insurance, as well as providing seamless experiences when and how customers 
need them. 

Embedded insurance—sold at the point of sale for a product or service—is not a new development: for 
years, electronics retailers have bundled warranty coverage and banks have distributed life products. 
Yet embedded insurance is evolving across industries, such as telcos and supermarkets, through the 
emergence of players that are building ecosystems of services and products that include insurance linked  
to original products. 

Embedded insurance has advanced most quickly in Asia, where a supportive regulatory environment, faster 
adoption of EVs and AVs, and unique platform dynamics have facilitated a robust growth landscape for 
carriers. We estimate Asia’s nonlife embedded insurance market will be worth about $170 billion by 2030.27 

Some players are expanding beyond embedded insurance to provide a full range of solutions. This 
progression is like that of bancassurance, which has been among the fastest-growing channels globally and 
now represents about 9 percent of nonlife premiums in Europe and as much as 25 percent of the market in 
Latin American countries such as Chile.28 Bancassurance’s progression started with life insurance linked to 
credit, expanded to home insurance linked to mortgages, and now includes a comprehensive suite of stand-
alone insurance products coupled with banking services. 

Similarly, retailers in Europe and Latin America are using their large physical footprints, frequent customer 
interactions, and new customer data to inform pricing and distribute a full suite of products coupled with 
traditional retail services.

In addition to expanding products, players including banks, retailers, and traditional carriers are turning to 
digital channels as customers grow accustomed to purchasing online. In Europe, this has primarily taken 
place through bancassurance, where nonlife digital channels doubled to 28 percent in 2022 compared 
with 14 percent in 2017. In Australia and the United States, digital sales have expanded beyond banks (for 
example, reaching 31 percent of premiums in Australia in 2023, compared with 16 percent in 2019).

28  Based on data from McKinsey bancassurance forums held in Latin America on August 31, 2023, and in Europe on November 15–16, 2023.

18

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthThese developments all bring insurance closer to the customer, when and how they need it, in a trusted 
environment. While distribution will not change overnight, competition is expected to intensify—with 
implications for carriers. First, the role of the traditional agent will need to evolve to provide more value to 
customers to maintain relevance in most segments, particularly in traditional auto and home lines. This 
includes offering more-comprehensive risk-based assessments on existing home insurance coverage gaps, 
education on technologies to aid risk prevention (such as connected devices), and more-comprehensive 
domain expertise (such as cybersecurity).

Further, cracking the code with the right partnerships (for instance, distribution partnerships with retailers 
or OEMs) will become critical for carriers to navigate nontraditional channels. These partnerships could 
create winner-takes-most environments with products such as EVs while simultaneously allowing carriers to 
access granular data and a wider customer base.

Gen AI is fueling wholesale reimagination of the value chain 
Advanced data and analytics capabilities in support of pricing sophistication and underwriting excellence 
are becoming table stakes for leading carriers across the globe. Carriers are doubling down on gen AI to 
reimagine the value chain end to end, developing lean organizations, establishing effective operations, and 
offering personalized experiences to customers. 

In sales and distribution, for example, gen AI–powered copilots for agents and other salespeople can 
provide real-time, step-by-step recommendations to agents based on a customer’s unique details. In 
pricing and underwriting, gen AI can extract insights from rate filings to inform new class plan features 
or even enable further granularity in segmentation from existing models (for example, personalizing 
offerings by individual, or a so-called “segmentation of one”). In claims, gen AI can improve accuracy of 
decision making by providing a “second set of eyes” and supporting adjusters in prioritizing workflows 
or significantly reducing the time typically spent reviewing documents. With customer service, gen AI–
powered chatbots can help provide real-time coaching to help representatives answer policy questions, 
reducing call handling time.

As carriers advance gen AI capabilities, the race for talent and data will intensify, given cross-industry 
competition for data scientists and engineers. Winning this race has direct implications for carriers in the 
near term, given that opportunities are available for capture.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growth3

Next steps: Three 
archetypes to find and  
enable growth

Individual carriers are already making deliberate choices and shifting their business models in response 
to the industry’s performance. While strategies will vary by region, we see three major carrier archetypes 
emerging, each with clear-cut areas of distinctiveness and short-term versus long-term strategies.

Core, at-scale players concentrated on insuring traditional coverage
Leading carriers will look to use their national scale, broad distribution network, and brand strength. As 
competition increases (through widening distribution channels, technological innovation, and more), these 
carriers will be required to ensure best-in-class technical excellence. Rewards will flow to those focusing on 
underwriting excellence to quickly adapt to underlying shifts in risks (such as making swift rate and nonrate 
actions and informing agile shifts in underwriting strategies through claims feedback loops) and offering 
highly productive customer service (such as by increasing automation in claims processes) while preserving 
a human touch where it is most valued. These carriers will still adapt products and distribution in response to 
the evolving market landscape (for instance, mobility trends and natural disasters) (Exhibit 7a).

Innovators expanding coverage through specialized products
These carriers will evolve specialized products sold through newer channels and insure new risks that 
remain unmet by the industry (for example, EVs or home exposures in high-risk areas). Although it is 
complicated, those who develop specialized products and insure new risks—through careful risk selection 
coupled with the right capabilities—may capitalize on industry needs and unlock profitable coverage. 
This will require a clearly defined strategy that experiments and learns in the short term—through product 
adaptations (such as usage-based insurance or white-labeling) and channel adaptations (such as an 
embedded and evolved role of agents)—and that scales to holistic coverage in the long term through 
comprehensive solutions and evolved channel coverage (partnership-based, proprietary, and more) 
(Exhibit 7b).

Targeted players differentiated through marketing, distribution, and servicing
These carriers will lean on their strong brand and networks in traditional product segments to address 
customer needs and offer best-in-class customer service within a specific geography, through a specific 
channel, or to a specific segment. Doing so requires a superior, targeted value proposition. In the short 
term, this implies tailoring existing products (for instance, microinsurance for a specific region or customer 
segment), forming partnerships and entering new channels (such as retail or digital), and investing in specific 
data and talent to strengthen underwriting. In the long term, it implies pursuing more-complex product 
sets across a customer’s lifetime, establishing a multichannel approach tailored to a specific geography, 
improving underwriting data, and offering best-in-class claims services as a differentiator (Exhibit 7c). 

These three archetypes are not mutually exclusive—in fact, future winners in the market will likely be those 
that leverage their existing position in the core to expand into adjacencies while strategically selecting 
niches in which to innovate. Doing so requires a comprehensive growth system.

To identify, plan for, and make the most of opportunities in the evolving market landscape, carriers can 
implement systems that approach growth comprehensively (through consistent tools, language, and 
tracking and reporting), promote unconstrained ideation (centered on customer needs and new knowledge 
and expertise), build long-term capabilities (such as by integrating the growth system approach into existing 
client-facing and internal processes), instill value assurance (through a single source of truth, as well as 
through transparency and rigor in planning and performance), and shift leadership mindsets and culture  
(for example, by creating a “business builder” mindset).

We believe that the industry’s outlook is positive and that, going forward, players will seek to innovate and 
expand coverage in the pursuit of profitable growth, increasing the industry’s relevance as a result.

Introduction

In an industry that revolves around reducing uncertainty for customers, commercial P&C insurers are 
themselves confronting macroeconomic uncertainty across multiple fronts.

 — Inflation has remained stickier than expected in many economies, and in regions where it persists, 

customers are likely to retain more risk than usual, creating pressure on growth.

 — While interest rates are beginning to decline in some markets, uncertainty remains as central banks 

revise timetables for monetary easing,1 directly affecting insurers’ ability to project investment returns.

 — Consumer confidence is shaky even though the economic growth cycle appears to have bottomed out 

across most economies, including those most relevant for the commercial lines industry.2

 — Geopolitical instability and the associated possibilities of supply chain disruptions3 are among the top 
perceived threats to global growth and can have wide-ranging implications for commercial insurers in 
the coming years, especially in certain lines, such as marine cargo and business interruption.

 — Trade patterns are shifting, with signs of protectionism on the horizon: the number of new global trade 

restrictions has steadily increased, from about 650 in 2017 to more than 3,000 in 2023.4

This macroeconomic environment calls for cautious optimism about the prospect of continued economic 
expansion, balanced by the potential for periods of slow to no growth, given the market’s turbulence.

But commercial P&C also faces other headwinds.5 Climate risks are increasing, especially as a result of 
severe convective storms: last year was the warmest on record, and scientists estimate there is a one-in-
three chance that 2024 will be even hotter.6 Additionally, corporate legal defense spending on class  
action lawsuits in the United States increased by 8 percent in 2022 and by 5 percent in 2021.7 This leads to 
higher claims costs and ultimately has a negative impact on affordability across the industry.

While turbulence in the market is expected to prevail in coming years, insurers cannot rely on continually 
rising premiums, or a continuation of today’s hard cycle, to drive growth. That’s why it’s a critical time for them 
to reassess how they will capture growth profitably as they navigate this shifting landscape.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growth1

Finding growth beyond 
rate increases

Global commercial property and casualty (P&C) insurance lines continued to deliver strong growth  
despite more recent evidence of softening conditions. Premiums increased by an average of 8 percent 
annually during the past five years, while the average combined ratio for the industry trended downward  
to an estimated 91 percent in 2023 (Exhibit 1).8

across European and North American markets was entirely the result of higher rates during the past five 
years, while factors unrelated to rates reduced overall premium growth (Exhibit 2).9

With insurance rates showing signs of softening in select lines such as financial and professional liability, 
there is now a global imperative to find growth through something other than increasing rates. The challenge 
is already evident: global composite rates held flat in the second quarter of 2024 for the first time in close to 
seven years, having decelerated consistently since the final quarter of 2020.10

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthTo combat this pricing uncertainty and the potential of further softening, insurers must consider alternative 
growth scenarios. They need to reassess the clarity and focus of their strategies, the distinctiveness  
of their capabilities, and their efficiency and agility. For example, underwriting operations are often slow 
to react to changing market conditions, and insurers need to ensure they are nimble enough to shift their 
strategies should rates soften.

Is demand for commercial insurance growing? Not fast enough, as protection 
gaps widen.

This dynamic aligns with our previous findings that the commercial P&C industry continues to risk losing 
relevance in a changing world—a trend that has continued with a widening of the protection gap, or the 
difference between economic losses and insured losses.11

The global protection gap for natural catastrophes grew to $262 billion in 2023 from $181 billion in 2022, 
with losses last year also materially above the long-term figure. The majority of disaster losses were covered 
in the United States but not in other regions.12 In addition, a massive protection gap persists for cyberthreats: 
less than 1 percent of global cyber costs are insured,13 with premiums projected to reach about $23.0 billion 
by 2025 but cybercrime costs expected to reach $10.5 trillion by 2025.14

The global protection gap for natural 
catastrophes grew to $262 billion in 
2023 from $181 billion in 2022, with 
losses last year also materially above  
the long-term figure.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthCustomers are also navigating rising insurance costs by assuming more risk. Periods of higher rates typically 
see growth in captives (a form of self-insurance in which the insurer is owned by the insured party), and  
there has been a steady increase in usage globally: surveys suggest captive usage hit 25 percent in 2023, 
up from 17 percent in 2021.15 The global market value is projected to reach $250 billion by 2028.16 By  
using captives, which can have expense ratios of as low as 1 to 5 percent,17 commercial customers avoid  
the higher cost burden of 20 to 40 percent expense ratios underpinning the premiums of primary insurers, 
and gain direct access to the reinsurance market through the captive.

In addition, many customers—particularly small and medium-size enterprises—are simply declining 
coverage on some commercial risks to manage their costs. In the United Kingdom, for example, more than 
half of small businesses stopped buying at least one insurance product in 2022,18 while 75 percent of small 
businesses in the United States are estimated to have insufficient insurance.19

Narrowing these protection gaps represents a key growth opportunity for insurers and requires creative 
solutions that overcome barriers associated with the higher cost of protection (for example, through product 
flexibility and innovation or customization of coverages). And it points to a deeper long-term need for 
insurers to maintain and increase their relevance in a changing world by finding innovative, cost-effective 
ways to meet the needs of customers across rate cycles, while being intentional about where and how  
they grow to ensure that new growth is profitable.

Profitability can be elusive

Across commercial P&C, specialty lines are the only ones to have delivered consistent and meaningful levels 
of profitability globally during the current cycle. The combined ratio for specialty lines has consistently 
remained below 100, while ratios for other lines, such as accident, property, and motor, have typically stayed 
above that level—indicating they are regularly paying out more than they are receiving in premiums  
(Exhibit 3).

Yet a deeper look at specialty-focused insurers finds even they haven’t been able to secure consistent 
profitability. Net combined ratios among specialized insurers exhibited the highest degree of variability 
compared with their more diversified peers, raising questions related to the merits of trading variability  
for profitability.20

The challenge:  
Capturing and sustaining 
profitable growth

While there has been no clear path to consistent profitability in recent years for specialized insurers or  
those with diverse lines of business exposure, good performance, when earned, can be persistent. Insurers 
must now focus on how they capture consistent, profitable growth amid the shifting market landscape.

Our analysis of the performance of 25 global commercial P&C insurers during the past decade highlights the 
challenge. While there is not a strong correlation between growth and profitability, there are clear leaders that 
are able to sustain differentiated performance over time. When ranked based on net combined operating ratio 
(COR), most insurers have stayed in the same performance quartile during the past decade: five out of seven 
insurers in the top quartile (20 percent of the total) remained in the top quartile, only two of 11 middle-performer 
insurers (8 percent of total) moved to the top, and none from the bottom quartile made it to the top (Exhibit 4).21 

Just 40 percent of an insurer’s 
performance is driven by the lines  
of business it participates in, while  
60 percent of performance is driven by 
how it operates. This dynamic applies 
across both soft- and hard-cycle years.

In addition, not all insurers able to grow did so profitably. Several in the bottom quartile of profitability 
exhibited relatively high growth, particularly in recent years, perhaps trading profitability for growth. Such 
insurers may need to rethink their growth strategies to remain viable in the longer term.

How insurers play drives performance more than where they play

Although where insurers operate is important, the majority of their financial performance is driven by how 
they operate. Just 40 percent of an insurer’s performance is driven by the lines of business it participates 
in, while 60 percent of performance is driven by how it operates. This dynamic applies across both soft- and 
hard-cycle years and applies generally, although factors such as regional differences may lead to exceptions 
(Exhibit 5).22 While effective portfolio strategy should not be disregarded, execution matters even more, and 
insurers should double down on their capabilities in their core lines of business to achieve profitable growth. 

22  Analysis calculates an artificially weighted combined ratio for 24 global commercial lines insurers based on industry business line weights. 
It uses an industry-weighted business line mix while maintaining each insurer’s combined ratio performance in individual business lines. 
The relative outperformance or underperformance of these artificially weighted combined ratios is then compared to that of the realized 
combined ratios. This comparison is used to assess the impact of the “how” versus “where” to play decision. Based on Pro Database, S&P

While execution always matters, its contribution varies for different players. How an insurer plays matters 
more to performance for top performers (about 60 percent of performance relates to execution) than  
for insurers in the bottom quartile (about 52 percent). This suggests top performers may be focusing on lines 
of business in which they have already established a “right to win,” while bottom performers have  
a greater opportunity to improve their portfolio choices. Once insurers establish the right portfolio mix  
in which they have the right to win, sustaining performance requires doubling down on the capabilities  
that drive strong execution. For those in the bottom performance quartile, both levers can make a 
meaningful difference.

Four key drivers of 
superior commercial 
P&C performance

How do top-performing commercial P&C insurers achieve sustained profitable growth and competitive 
advantage? Our analysis found four areas of distinctiveness drive superior performance: the clarity and focus 
of their growth strategy, investments in strengthening underwriting operations and driving excellence in  
risk selection, reduced acquisition costs while navigating a changing distribution landscape, and achieving 
operational efficiencies across the value chain to manage administration expenses.

Leaders have clear strategies to capture profitable growth

Portfolio management has always been critical to the success of commercial P&C insurers in balancing 
diversification and placing bets on the lines that are most attractive. Leaders go a step further and have  
a clear value proposition and risk appetite that are well communicated and understood internally and 
externally, and make focused investments in capabilities that guide execution, such as specific channels  
and talent. As a result, leading insurers are twice as likely as lagging peers to have publicly announced clear 
and targeted growth strategies.23 This is true regardless of where the insurer plays, and hence we see this 
clarity and focus as more of the how equation. Given the market is experiencing broad structural shifts  
(such as new risks and the entry or exit of players and capacity), insurers are likely to be required to establish 
even more targeted strategies and value propositions to capture profitable growth where they decide  
to play. 

Insurers must have distinctive capabilities where they choose to compete
It is critical that insurers establish clear growth strategies to ensure they compete where they have a right 
to win. Some insurers are reinventing their portfolios by decisively placing strategic bets on specialized, niche 
businesses. For example, cyber insurance has become increasingly available; some insurers are building 
capabilities to provide coverage for financial liabilities for investment management,24 while others are 
creating directors and officers products tailored to specific sectors, such as private equity. These are being 
done either alone25 or through partnerships with other players, depending on the right to win.26

Some US insurers are investing further in growth in their non-admitted or excess and surplus (E&S) 
businesses to leverage the greater agility they offer: non-admitted and E&S premiums grew by 20 percent 
year over year in the United States from 2018 to 2023, with insurers increasingly offering specialized 
products in the space.27

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthModels requiring limited underwriting involvement continue to grow
Premiums written through managing general agents (MGAs) by insurers primarily engaged in commercial 
lines28 grew by about 18 percent year over year in the United States in 2020–23, compared to about  
11 percent growth in total premiums.29 MGAs have also shown significant growth outside the United States. 
Cyber insurance has emerged as one of the most commonly cited examples of insurers partnering  
with MGAs,30 but MGAs have also helped provide underwriting expertise for many other lines, such as 
marine cargo.31

Furthermore, in the Lloyd’s of London market, smart follow32 syndicates are experiencing growth that far 
outpaces the market.33 Yet while growth has been supported by rate hardening, it is becoming clear that the 
business driven by insurers’ lead underwriting capabilities is at risk of shrinking—making this portion of  
the market increasingly competitive in the years ahead. That’s particularly the case if the industry follows 
the trend of more passive participation (such as through MGAs or smart follow syndicates) seen in asset 
management, where passive funds overtook active funds in terms of assets for the first time in 2023, just  
30 years after beginning to gain popularity.34 

That’s why it is even more important that insurers establish targeted underwriting strategies in areas  
where they are able to establish distinctive capabilities.35 For areas where insurers are not able to establish 
distinctive underwriting capabilities, they can consider playing in the market passively to gain access 
through more external underwriters—or not playing at all.

Investors want clear growth strategies from insurers
Insurers need to articulate clear growth narratives to investors to give them confidence and ensure they 
have the requisite access to capital to achieve their growth strategies. Investors can now diversify exposure 
to various lines of business and markets more easily than ever, and they are looking for insurers to focus  
on where they have a right to win.

McKinsey has previously noted that traditional sources of capital continue to be challenged.36 Insurers have 
had to turn to alternative sources of capital to grow their businesses and must be prepared to do so in the 
coming years. In fact, alternative sources of capital grew 7 percent in 2023, and total deployed alternative 
capital surpassed $100 billion for the first time.37 Insurers have innovated and developed insurance-linked 
securities such as cyber catastrophe bonds, which have had significant success in the market.38 And  
private capital is looking to partner down the value chain to bring new capacity, creating an opportunity for 
commercial insurers.39

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthFor global public commercial insurers, the share of intrinsic investors (those tending to hold positions in  
a small number of companies for long periods) in the investor base has been steadily decreasing, falling to  
28 percent in 2023 from 41 percent a decade earlier.40 Public insurers can benefit from discussing clear and 
targeted growth strategies with market participants. The top criterion for intrinsic investors in the market  
is whether a company has a sustainable advantage over key competitors.41 Insurers must have a clear 
answer to investors on the question of how they play.

Top performers invest in modernizing underwriting

Top-performing insurers exhibit loss ratios an average of six percentage points lower than other insurers 
and are almost twice as likely to have made significant investments in underwriting operations relative  
to peers in the bottom performance quartile.42 A key factor? Embracing technological advancements to 
hone their underwriting distinctiveness. This is not a new trend, but recent shifts have accelerated  
the pace and widened the aperture for what is possible while navigating the complexity of legacy systems 
and processes.

Leading insurers are leveraging a wide range of data sources, generative AI, and more traditional AI and 
machine learning (ML) to rethink their end-to-end underwriting journeys and build distinctive decision-
making capabilities that drive quality and scalability. As a key component of “how you play,” significant 
investment in underwriting capabilities is required to remain competitive in targeted areas where insurers 
choose to compete.

For global public commercial insurers, 
the share of intrinsic investors in 
the investor base has been steadily 
decreasing, falling to 28 percent in  
2023 from 41 percent a decade earlier.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthGenerative AI has wide applicability 
Insurers are deploying generative AI in commercial lines to automate algorithmic underwriting,43 implement 
chatbots that embed institutional know-how in underwriting workflows,44 improve the underwriting 
submission process,45 and streamline market intelligence to enable more efficient portfolio management.46 
Yet while there has been a flurry of announcements, few initiatives have been scaled—although there is 
optimism given the industry’s newfound speed of change. For example, one insurer announced the launch 
of a proof of concept within its terrorism business to build capabilities it can later expand: using AI to 
cleanse data inputs to the model, automatically geocoding locations, and mapping the properties to support 
underwriters in risk selection and portfolio optimization—and transforming a three-day process into one 
that takes just seconds.47 We expect leading insurers will make significant progress this year toward building 
generative AI (gen AI) expertise across their organizations.

Advancements in gen AI have also reinvigorated the case for traditional AI and ML investments in 
underwriting capabilities. For example, insurers are using climate data to sharpen risk selection and 
underwriting decisions.48 AI has enabled insurers to exploit a wide and varying array of data sources, 
including tax assessments, satellite imagery, real estate data, and other sources to better enhance risk 
models in a highly scalable way. 49

Competition for talent is intensifying
Frontline underwriters remain at the forefront of growth, and competition for quality underwriting talent 
continues to intensify. Attracting and retaining the best underwriting professionals relative to other players, 
such as MGAs, hinges on the ability to provide the tools, analytics, and efficient workflows that maximize 
their productivity and impact. During the past five years, leading MGAs have reported retaining more than 
95 percent of their underwriting talent,50 with early adoption of technology fostering an attractive, cutting-
edge environment.51 Insurers must adapt to compete for talent with such players and can use their distinctive 
technology tool kits to recruit.

Insurers must navigate a changing distribution landscape

The distribution landscape continues to evolve, and insurers must rethink how they use broad sets of 
channels such as delegated authorities, compete for profitability with brokers as they seek growth, and 
harness digital advancements to achieve commercial excellence. Leading insurers have focused on gaining 
efficiencies in driving down acquisition costs in recent years, decreasing their acquisition expense ratio  
by two percentage points on average between 2013–17 and 2018–23. By comparison, lagging peers saw 
their acquisition expense ratios worsen by two percentage points over the same period.52 This underscores  
why a focus on commercial excellence is an integral point of differentiation to capture distinctive 
performance. Yet if the market softens, competition for growth can be expected to increase and there  
will be a heightened imperative for insurers to think differently about commercial excellence.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthInsurer–broker relations will become even more important
As brokers have gained significant importance, they have extracted a substantial share of value from  
the industry during this five-year hard cycle. Brokers delivered average annual total shareholder returns  
of approximately 19 percent compared with about 14 percent for insurers.53 And while top brokers have 
traditionally gained scale through consolidation,54 the outlook is mixed: brokerage M&A activity is slowing  
in North America,55 although total European brokerage M&A activity accelerated by 33 percent year  
over year with a record 502 transactions announced in 2023.56

Broker relationships will become even more important as insurers seek to meet the imperative for profitable 
growth within this evolving broker landscape and changing rate environment. Both insurers and brokers 
should focus on establishing strategic relationships, specifically in the areas of the market that align with 
their targeted growth strategy. 

Insurers should think about the value-added services they provide brokers and invest in those capabilities. 
The services should improve ease of doing business for strategic partners (for example, API connections 
and self-serve platforms) and provide marketing and sales support (such as enhanced product training). 
Compelling broker compensation structures can also provide better alignment in insurer-broker relationships 
and support insurers in their efforts to build targeted strategies and distinctive capabilities. 

Insurers should manage the quality of their distribution networks
Most insurers have significant variability in book performance across their individual agents and brokers, 
requiring more diligence and performance management to ensure a greater focus on profitable growth. For 
example, insurers have worked with MGAs to grow premiums significantly in recent years. But even though 
insurers are adopting more-passive growth strategies in this area, they still need to be selective in how they 
grow through this channel, especially in softer markets, to avoid diluting rigor in underwriting and product 
design. For example, a study of the wider P&C industry in the United States found that among 13 insurers 
operating with an affiliated model that became insolvent between 2017 and 2022, more than 88 percent of 
direct premiums written were sourced through the affiliated MGA in the year prior to insolvency.57 Insurers 
will need to perform greater due diligence in business underwritten by MGAs to ensure the quality of 
business that is being channeled to them. 

Digital connectivity is transforming the purchase of insurance 
Digitalization allows for greater speed and simplicity, reducing friction between brokers and underwriters. 
And increased market participation and visibility stemming from digital trading platforms—which digitally 
connect brokers and underwriters—may even raise the expectations brokers and clients have for insurers 
themselves. Trading platforms are expanding across commercial lines to facilitate the transition from today’s 
approach, which relies on emails and documents held in organizational silos, to a future of structured data 
that digitally connects clients with potential coverage solutions in real time.58 User experience is at the 
forefront, with platforms focused on removing pain points and offering a streamlined journey through the 
placement life cycle.59 Third-party technology providers are also supporting the digital transition—for example, 
by equipping brokers and insurers with tools to find and win new business with greater efficiency.60

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthLeaders manage administration expenses through operational efficiencies

Insurers in the leading performance quartile, on average, maintain administration expense ratios two 
percentage points lower than their peers. Overall, global insurers improved their administration  
expense ratios across cycles when comparing the periods from 2013 to 2017 and 2018 to 2023—but  
that metric does not tell the whole story.

Declines in expense ratio may not be enough
While leading insurers have been more effective at managing administration expense ratios since the start 
of the hard cycle, such actions may not be enough going forward, especially in a slowing rate environment.  
In fact, when normalizing for both rate increases and inflation, administration expense ratios in the industry 
are higher today than they were five years ago (Exhibit 6).61 To maintain the same ratio of administration 
expenses in 2023 as in 2018 (adjusted for rate growth), insurers will need to eliminate nearly $10 billion  
in expenses.62

AI has enabled real efficiency improvements across the value chain. For example, by incorporating broker- 
or customer-facing chatbots into customer service processes, insurers can achieve quicker responses and 
higher satisfaction. The technology can also streamline processing of broker submissions, improve the 
speed of delivery to customers, and improve productivity in claims management.63 For example, gen AI can 
synthesize large, unstructured files that are key inputs to claims processing, while some commercial insurers 
are using AI-powered engines to triage claims and assign them to the correct adjusters.64 More effective 
collaboration between insurers’ claims and legal organizations also enables better litigation management, 
which is especially relevant in an environment of increased litigation.

Yet before implementing additional gen AI use cases, carriers must be able to create an efficient end-to-end 
operating model, scale it, and automate it to maximize flexibility as they adapt operations and address future 
challenges. This will matter even more if rates soften. For example, product-centric operating models may 
allow for underwriting talent to be moved between product offerings to meet changing market conditions, 
providing insurers with greater control and scalability. What matters most, though, is that operating models 
are designed in alignment with the specific, profitable growth strategy of each insurer and steered as 
adjustments are required.

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthConclusion

Commercial P&C insurers face a changing marketplace, challenged by the uncertainty of macroeconomic 
factors and increased competition from players that are harnessing the power of focused and innovative 
solutions. Yet insurers can view these changes as opportunities for growth, looking to expand beyond 
premium increases by closing the widening protection gap and reducing the prevalence of self-insurance 
among companies.

To be leading players in the future of the industry and capture profitable growth, insurance carriers must 
focus on establishing distinctive capabilities and double down on how they play in addition to where 
they play. Doing so requires establishing clear and targeted strategies, modernizing their underwriting 
capabilities, and optimizing the efficiency of their operations. In an industry in which winners keep winning, 
inflection points such as the current one present the chance for insurers to separate from the pack.

Introduction

In an industry centered on providing protection against risk, it seems appropriate that the past year was one 
of unpredictable mixed signals, uncertainty, and surprising upsides for the world’s life insurance industry.

Unexpectedly resilient macroeconomic conditions provided tailwinds: global GDP grew by 3.2 percent 
in real terms1 in 2023 and continued that growth rate into 2024, inflation last year steadily decreased 
from 8.7 percent to 6.8 percent,2 and the MSCI World Index reversed from negative 18 percent to positive 
24 percent, reflecting robust global financial performance throughout 2023.3 

This macroeconomic environment—especially relatively high global interest rates—improved the 
attractiveness of net-interest-spread products and increased the importance of distinctive asset 
management as a source of value creation. Yet this positive result was largely concentrated in the United 
States, where individual annuity sales boomed at a 23 percent CAGR from 2021 to 2023, reaching 
$385 billion in sales last year,4 with strong growth continuing into the first half of 2024 as sales rose 
19 percent year over year.5 The United Kingdom has also experienced strong individual annuity growth 
rates, with year-over-year sales in the first half of 2024 jumping by 50 percent.6 The success of group 
annuities, including pension risk transfers, was marked by a year of record transaction value in the United 
Kingdom and a record number of transactions in the United States as insurance carriers sought scale, given 
macroeconomic tailwinds to their investment income.7  

Growth in other products and markets was more muted. Term life is stagnant or shrinking in most major 
markets in the world. Endowments (including whole life products) are also stagnating—most notably in 
France, Germany, and Italy, where premiums remained flat from 2021 to 2023. Japan is an exception: 
it experienced strong growth driven by the postpandemic recovery of the critical face-to-face agency 
channel, growing demand for simple short-term protection, and continued popularity of dollar-denominated 
products. Unit-linked policies are struggling against competition from asset management products in the 
United States and Europe but show encouraging growth in Japan and China. In the United States, a fast-
growing voluntary products market is offsetting stagnation in the more traditional large corporate group 
protection market (Exhibit 1). 

Finally, the global health insurance industry was strong in 2023, ending the year with premiums of 
approximately $1.8 trillion, according to data from McKinsey Global Insurance Pools.8 While North America 
accounts for two-thirds of premiums, Europe’s share is growing at approximately 3.5 percent annually and 
is expected to continue, in part because of the region’s laws mandating health insurance. Brazil and Mexico 
are also growing—at 7 to 8 percent a year—as their middle classes continue to emerge.

In short, there are bright pockets of growth across the globe—perhaps more so in the past two years than 
in the past decade. But overall? Traditional products and major markets are stagnant, and the industry is in 
search of growth and relevance.

Embracing a changing 
landscape

The life and retirement industry has been struggling for relevance, as evidenced by growth that lags behind 
global GDP and its shrinking importance in capital markets. However, there are structural forces at work 
that, if successfully harnessed, could help the industry spur consumer demand and drive a resurgence.

‘Silver’ is taking over, and ‘life’ is being redefined

The life insurance market is being reshaped by the aging global “silver” population of people aged 65 or 
older and the concentration of wealth among Generation X9 and retirees. The silver population is expected 
to double to 1.6 billion by 2050 (representing 16 percent of the global population),10 with “super aged” 
societies—in which more than 20 percent of the population is aged 65 or older—already emerging in 
countries such as Italy and Japan.

This creates a compelling opportunity for insurers to address the growing demand for retirement solutions 
tailored to an aging population, especially as fraying social safety nets leave gaps in financial stability and 
retirement security. With respect to government-provided, employer-based, and individual pension savings 
in eight major markets alone, there was an estimated $106 trillion retirement savings gap in 2022, expected 
to grow to $483 trillion by 2050.11  

At the same time, changing social norms and ways of living—such as fewer marriages, lower fertility rates, 
and more dual-income households—are challenging the traditional life insurance model. For example, life 
insurance penetration in the United States has dropped to roughly half of the population,12 and the number 
of policies in force is down roughly 13 percent since 2011.13 Life insurers will be expected to offer more 
flexible policies that cater to nontraditional family structures and are part of integrated financial planning  
as the value propositions of pure protection or endowments (including whole life) erodes.

Customer experience at the forefront

As consumers increasingly interact with digitally native service providers across virtually all facets of their 
lives, customer experience has become a critical differentiator for life insurers—allowing best performers 
to deepen customer relationships and drive operational efficiency. Our research shows that moving from 
the bottom quartile to the top in customer experience can result in up to a 30 percent increase in the rate 
of winning new business and a 20 to 30 percent reduction in policy cancellations. From 2017 to 2022, 
insurers making that move delivered an increase of more than 20 percentage points in cumulative return to 
shareholders.14 In Asia, several insurers have begun expanding into integrated services, betting these “one 
stop” digital applications will increase the traditionally low number of touchpoints life insurers have with their

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthcustomers. It is no surprise that China is leading innovation, given almost one in five Chinese consumers 
prefers to engage digitally across the life insurance value chain.15 

Yet globally, life insurance still trails in digital capabilities and customer service, resulting in worse 
outcomes. Leading financial-services providers outside of insurance, such as banks, achieve customer 
satisfaction scores three and five times higher than those of median life and annuity players, respectively.16 
While not all life insurance consumers prefer digital services, recent trends indicate a narrowing gap 
between preferences for in-person and online interactions. Insurers have an opportunity to invest in digital 
capabilities to enhance customer service, streamline processes, and provide personalized experiences. 
To do this, insurance carriers must find new ways to attract tech talent, overcome the typically high cost to 
modernize legacy systems, and address the inherently lower-engagement nature of life insurance.

Continued divergence between public and private market perceptions

Publicly listed insurers experienced better results in 2023 than in previous years but continue to lose 
relevance and lag behind financial-services peers as investors focus on cash and capital return (Exhibit 2).

rate environment and some refocusing on growth are helping public investor perception, but a lack of

Private capital continues to grow in relevance. Insurers backed by private capital—such as those owned by 
private equity firms—have completed more than $800 billion worth of life and annuity transactions globally 
since 201219 and now account for 13 percent20 of general account assets in the United States and roughly 
35 percent of fixed and fixed-indexed annuity sales.21 Elsewhere, private capital is flowing to the $200 billion 
of reserves in the UK bulk-purchase-annuity market and, via private-capital-backed reinsurance solutions, 
to the $600 billion in reserves of whole-life and fixed annuities in Japan. Private capital–backed insurers 
are making distinct choices on risk appetite and asset allocation (for example, higher allocation to illiquid 
and private assets) while leveraging the sophisticated capabilities of their private capital parents to access 
private assets. As we discuss in the next section, traditional insurers are increasingly following suit.

Avenues of growth and 
value creation beyond 
‘traditional’ life insurance

Insurance carriers face a dual challenge: making a step change in their ability to create value while 
meeting the evolving needs of consumers and society. The response demands going beyond traditional 
life insurance, with four immediate axes for growth: regaining relevance and winning in retirement, moving 
toward integrated wealth solutions, finding new avenues to serve customers and advisers, and expanding 
into asset management.

Regain relevance and win in retirement

For many years, developed countries have been experiencing aging populations, fraying social safety 
nets, and rising healthcare costs. However, the conditions are now in place for a renewed effort from life 
insurance carriers to meet retirement needs and regain relevance. 

First, higher interest rates over the past two years and recent macroeconomic uncertainty have renewed the 
fundamental product value proposition for a new cohort of pre-retirees and retirees. Their advisers, many 
for the first time in their careers, are acknowledging and embracing the role of protection and endowment 
products in retirement portfolios alongside competing solutions.

Second, demographics are shifting much of the retirement asset pool into its decumulation phase, 
particularly across the major insurance markets. This is a timely and powerful opportunity for life insurers to 
regain relevance by providing a stable, secure retirement income for life, holding on to accumulated assets 
that would have been ceded to asset and wealth managers during the past three decades. 

The market bifurcated in recent years between capital-light and capital-heavy models, with many insurers 
making strategic commitments to one or the other in the context of low interest rates and challenged 
returns. With long-term interest rate expectations shifting and policy makers adjusting their stance on 
certain products, life insurers globally have an opportunity to accelerate growth by building innovative 
decumulation solutions that, for example, incorporate guaranteed income, market upside, and an element 
of downside protection. This will not mean just repeating strategies from the previous era of higher interest 
rates two decades ago; successful strategies now will recognize the ways in which the industry has changed 
and look for opportunities for innovation, while planning for future uncertainty. 

For instance, in the United States, access to qualified retirement savings is expanding, and more insurers, 
partnering with asset managers, are embedding annuities in more traditional retirement products such as 
target-date funds (TDFs), which are a particularly relevant opportunity for life insurers. Net flows into TDFs 
are forecast to grow more in percentage and absolute terms than any other in-plan asset class. Meaningful 
access to this $3.2 trillion asset pool24 is an attractive source of growth; while at least ten TDFs have

of the total TDF market—suggesting there is ample headroom for insurers to make further inroads. For 
instance, annuities could transition to products that are bought by “default,” not sold—such as TDFs—which 
requires partnerships with asset managers, product innovation to resolve challenges around portability, and 
operational improvements to handle large numbers of new contract holders. The United States is seeing 
an increased number of product enhancements and new-product launches as firms seek to capitalize 
on attractive annuity markets and opportunities opened up by the 2020 SECURE Act. Major players 
announced nearly 30 product launches or notable product enhancements in the annuity and variable 
universal life market in 2022–23, compared with less than half a dozen in 2019.26

In the United Kingdom, where capital-light retirement assets are forecast to grow at 8 percent annually 
during the next decade,27 winners will build strong relationships with end customers during the accumulation 
phase, even when intermediated by an employer or corporate pension trustee. This should increase 
their ability to support customers holistically across their financial needs and to retain assets through 
decumulation with a broader set of capabilities, including annuities.

In Asia, insurance carriers can introduce products that better address retirement financial needs. This 
means partnering with asset managers for better returns and injecting more flexibility into product design, 
from varied payment structures to payout terms, retirement ages, and lower fees. In emerging markets in 
Asia, with younger populations, insurers are taking inspiration from other markets by introducing new asset 
accumulation products such as target-date funds and alternative asset funds; meanwhile, there may be 
opportunity among the growing number of homeowners for reverse mortgage products for decumulation 
needs. Such innovations will be a step into the unknown for some in Asia, meaning investment is required 
in risk management and asset and liability management capabilities. Insurance carriers will also need to 
evolve their risk appetites to build the retirement propositions demanded, invest in education and training of 
agents, and create compelling incentives to drive growth. 

Move toward integrated wealth and health solutions 

The line between life and wealth solutions has become increasingly blurred as customer preferences evolve 
across demographics. Modern consumers actively seek advisers capable of addressing all of their financial 
needs, which involves understanding and addressing customers better through greater personalization and 
delivering on a holistic set of needs in an integrated experience.

In Europe, life products have long been integrated into wealth-focused distribution channels; insurers are 
now recognizing the opportunity to expand from single-product manufacturers to a comprehensive suite of 
financial services, directly offering high-net-worth individuals traditional insurance products with banking 
services. By integrating banking capabilities, they can offer personalized wealth management, investment 
opportunities, and bespoke financial solutions that cater to the complex needs of clients.

In the United States, both advisers and insurers are recognizing the opportunity to better serve clients 
through holistic financial plans, in turn capturing diversified recurring revenue streams from wealth 
management products and distribution. A growing focus on fee-only and fiduciary advisory models is 
accelerating the need for insurers to provide their advisers and customers with a full suite of financial 
products. Increasingly, “wealth only” or “life only” advisers are unable to meet the full needs of clients: 
roughly 80 percent of insurance agents now offer some form of financial planning advice compared with

about 18 percent in 2020 to 33 percent in 2022.28

In Asia’s wealth hubs, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, we see a convergence across wealth, life, and 
even health services. Some insurance carriers have launched “wealth and health centers,” while others 
are creating programs to integrate health, wealth, and estate planning for individuals with high and 
ultrahigh net worth. Customers want more holistic financial advice, which is creating opportunities for 
insurers to meaningfully serve wealth needs. This requires insurers to be thoughtful about both product 
innovation and their capabilities to deliver these products, with a particular reliance on strong investment 
management capabilities.

In this context, it is crucial for insurers to clearly define and position the value proposition of life insurance 
products versus other financial instruments such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 
especially when considering the benefits products such as annuities provide in situations of wealth transfer, 
which will be a significant theme in the coming decades. By embracing the synergies between life insurance 
and wealth management, insurers can offer a holistic approach to financial planning, meeting evolving client 
needs and ensuring sustained growth and competitiveness in a dynamic market.

In addition to underpinning financial security into old age, the industry must also decide the extent of its role 
in supporting quality of life. While average life expectancy has increased by almost 20 years since 1960, the 
proportion of life spent in poor or moderate health (around 50 percent) has not changed, creating a pressing 
need for every industry to recognize its fundamental relevance to health and invest in bold, disruptive 
strategies.29 The life insurance industry is uniquely suited to enter health adjacencies, an emerging trend 
in Asia and the United States, through which some insurers are partnering with or acquiring healthcare 
and senior-care providers to address rising costs of longevity and care. Others are investing in wellness 
solutions to improve the long-term health of contract holders and reduce the need for care. Both represent 
a shift from “income protection” to “retirement protection” and a shift from single-channel, infrequent 
customer engagement to engaging with customers in new and different ways. Both also require big bets in 
capabilities and markets that life insurance carriers have not traditionally operated in.

Find new avenues in which to serve customers and advisers

The declining penetration of life insurance, contrasted with its increased attractiveness, suggests there 
is an opportunity for insurance carriers to tell the story of protection to more consumers. This is especially 
true given that advisers are aging and spending increasing amounts of time advising on other products. 
Insurance carriers have been exploring differentiated access to customers through their adjacent 
businesses, such as worksite, and through data- and digital-augmented distribution that lowers advisers’ 
cost to serve their customers. 

In the United States, the broadening of intermediaries in the employee benefits ecosystem (such as 
professional employer organizations, benefits administrators, and human-capital managers) is moving 
insurance carriers further away from end customers, but a growing demand for voluntary products is 
blurring the lines, creating a section of the market that is increasingly focused on individuals. This growing 
demand is driven by consumers’ desire for choice and employers’ desire to shift costs to employees. 
In-force premiums of voluntary supplemental health products such as accident, hospital indemnity, critical 
illness, and cancer grew at a 6.5 percent CAGR between 2021 and 2023, nearly 1.5 times the growth rate of 
the rest of the group protection market.30 Sustaining this growth requires focused micromarket business

broker incentive structures, strong digital infrastructure, and a customer experience focused on education 
about these products, which are typically not well understood. Targeting small and midsize employers of 
fewer than 1,000 employees—an attractive strategy, given that overall market growth rates are almost 
double those of employers with 5,000 or more employees—will require further capabilities to cater to 
such organizations. 

In addition, as lines blur within the benefits ecosystem and between group and individual channels, 
multiline insurers are experimenting with ways to drive employee-level outreach and engage employees 
with a broader product portfolio, subject to local regulatory restrictions. In particular, some insurers see 
this channel as a cost-effective way to access middle-market customers who are harder to reach through 
the traditional agency channel. While nascent and currently at the margin (for example, pet insurance 
and personal cyber coverage), these trending products are also gaining traction in Asia, Mexico, and the 
United Kingdom. For instance, UK workplace pension providers are exploring ways to drive end-customer 
engagement and create “retail” relationships, starting with offering worksite financial education.

Successful implementation requires a meaningful shift in capabilities, given the transition from highly 
intermediated business-to-business-to-consumer relationships to direct consumer engagement. Winners 
in this space will be those that solve the problem of high customer acquisition costs and low margins. 
Digitally enabled distribution has been accelerating as a way to improve the customer (and adviser) 
experience and decrease the cost to serve, potentially offering another route to unlocking the middle 
market. Insurance carriers have been investing in digital platforms that support remote advice, use AI 
for personalized recommendations, and generate predictive analytics for advisers. Such platforms also 
integrate APIs with distribution partners to streamline interactions and improve efficiency and customer 
satisfaction. Developing these platforms and the digital infrastructure to connect across the ecosystem will 
enable life insurers to better serve their customers, drive product adoption, and ensure long-term success.

Activate the flywheel across insurance, asset management, and capital

As life insurance and asset management converge, value creation is driven by successful implementation 
of a “flywheel” approach. The flywheel consists of three components: issuance of insurance policies and 
annuities at scale, differentiated investment management, and capital management. 

The reward for winning in annuity origination at scale is permanent capital. Issuing annuities at scale 
requires insurers to respond quickly to changing market conditions, whether the customer is an individual, a 
corporation, or an institution. Best-in-class players will identify asset opportunities and almost immediately 
adjust their annuity pricing to distributors as a response. Naturally, scale also requires a deep and wide 
presence across geographies and distribution channels. This includes serious consideration of both the 
individual and institutional market, with the latter continuing to see ever-increasing, record-breaking deal 
flows in the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular. 

56

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthDifferentiated investment management requires insurers to make strategic choices on risk appetite and 
asset allocation, enabled by capabilities to access higher-yielding assets with appropriate risk/return 
considerations. For the best performers, this has meant building platforms for owning real assets and 
issuing loans directly to borrowers. In the United States, insurers and other nonbanks are increasingly 
participating in the space, having issued about 50 percent of commercial real estate loans in 2022.31 
In major endowments markets, such as France, Germany, and Italy, allocations to mortgages, loans, 
and alternative funds have doubled in the past six years to 12 percent.32 Given long-dated liabilities and 
opportunities for excess spread, there is excitement in the $40 trillion private credit market.33 Building such 
capabilities will also reposition the industry in its historical role of pivotal lender to ambitious economies, 
especially as banks continue to retreat from long-term lending. Furthermore, such capabilities in these 
assets have the self-reinforcing effect of allowing the insurer to offer more competitive prices to customers, 
gaining even more liabilities to fund further investment capabilities. 

Capital management requires greater flexibility as liabilities scale and asset composition evolves. With 
public markets continuing to doubt the sector as a whole, private capital will be critical for insurers seeking 
to build their flywheel and grow. Attracting such capital will require more than just offering private capital 
counterparts investment mandates; it will require the traditional insurer to demonstrate the ability to 
consistently deliver mid- to high-teens returns, which are expected by private investors and would position 
“insurance” as a stable return asset class. Done successfully, this will not only attract private capital but also 
help the industry regain the trust and attention of the public markets. 

The annuity insurers that are currently beneficiaries of private capital have typically leveraged reinsurance 
sidecars, which hold liabilities from the insurer and are capitalized by both the insurer and third-party 
investors (in return for midteens internal rates of return). Last year set a record for such sidecars, with more 
than $6 billion in capital raised across five vehicles in North America,34 equivalent to 60 percent of all capital 
raised via such vehicles since the first life and annuity sidecar launched in 2019, according to McKinsey 
analysis.

More-sophisticated capital management structures require that insurers build robust frameworks, 
modeling, and analytics to inform decisions on how capital should be best allocated across a growing 
number of balance sheet options (onshore, offshore, sidecar, third-party reinsurers, and divestment). 
Such capability builds are even more important in Asia, where capital management is rapidly evolving and 
globalizing in response to regulatory shifts and greater emphasis on profitability and cash flow. 

Insurers could pursue distinctiveness in all three components, offering a truly integrated flywheel model. 
This has largely been the approach of players backed by private capital. The next hurdles for such players 
will be further expansion of loan origination platforms and capabilities, including outside the United 
States; increased complexity of liabilities (such as long-term-care insurance); and a broader set of external 
investors to fuel growth. But for many, achieving distinctiveness in all three components may not be the

whether to double down on these areas. For instance, propriety-distribution-edge specialists can focus on 
building distinctive customer relationships and creating product development and underwriting capabilities, 
and then leverage partners for other elements of the flywheel. 

Life insurers executing this strategy will open up new opportunities for value creation but also new risks. 
Potentially higher-yielding assets such as asset-backed securities and real assets come with higher credit 
and liquidity risk. Regulators and governments are also closely monitoring developments to understand 
how future shocks would affect life insurers’ flywheels and, in turn, other parts of the broader economy. The 
strategy has also been executed to great effect by several players during a period of low interest rates—as 
spreads tighten and private capital hurdle rates increase with higher interest rates, the imperative for even 
greater sophistication in investment and risk management to drive value creation is heightened. 

58

Global Insurance Report 2025: The pursuit of growthConclusion

In protecting against uncertainty and helping individuals build wealth, life insurance carriers play a critical 
role in societies. Although the industry’s relevance has declined, there is an opportunity for insurers to 
harness emerging structural tailwinds and redefine their role beyond life insurance. Harnessing these 
structural forces and opportunities for value creation demands that insurers build new capabilities and 
step into new adjacencies, recalibrating their position across financial services, health, and longevity care. 
Now more than ever, going beyond traditional life insurance is a necessary and exciting growth imperative 
for the industry.
