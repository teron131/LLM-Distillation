Preface

In many ways, this report is long overdue. Asian 
Americans have long been part of American life 
and embody the full range of achievement. They 
are founders and CEOs of major corporations, 
entertainers and champion athletes, scientists 
and physicians, decorated military leaders and 
dedicated first responders, celebrated artists 
and iconic designers. And they are everyday 
contributors to our society—people who cook our 
food, take care of our loved ones, and continue to 
help build our country. 

In this report, we use the tools of data and 
analysis to advance the dialogue about Asian 
American workers. Despite their impressive 
accomplishments, Asian Americans remain 
largely overlooked and misunderstood in the US 
workplace and society, especially when it comes 
to subpopulations that have poor economic 
outcomes. As with other ethnic groups, Asian 
Americans are too often viewed as a monolith—a 
homogeneous population—rather than as 
a tapestry of cultures and experiences. This view, 
which includes the stereotype of Asian Americans 
as so-called model minorities who achieve 
above-average levels of socioeconomic success, 
is frequently oversimplified and a distortion of 
the true picture. It is important for corporate 

America to gain a more detailed understanding of 
Asian Americans. 

This issue also comes with some urgency. Over 
the past two and a half years, Asian Americans 
have been subject to increasing violence: one in 
six Asian American adults reported experiencing 
a hate crime or hate incident in 2021, up from 
one in eight just a year earlier.1 Acknowledging 
the challenges facing the Asian American 
community—individually and as a whole—is 
the first step to ensuring this community, and thus 
America, is able to fulfill its potential. 

Our report uses research to underscore 
the need for more—and more expansive—studies 
and conversations about Asian Americans. 
The challenges they face in the workplace are too 
rarely recognized. By illuminating the experiences 
of Asian American workers, we can pinpoint some 
specific challenges and opportunities that few 
companies have recognized. But we don’t claim to 
have all the answers for how to create an optimal 
environment for Asian American workers. 

There will always be nuances to discover, and this 
report represents an early effort to dismantle 
some generalizations that do not serve Asian 
Americans or their workplaces. We hope 
the conversation continues and expands.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesIntroduction

The Asian American population in the United 
States numbers nearly 20 million and is growing 
quickly2: it doubled in the past 20 years and is 
projected to double again in the next 40 years 
(Exhibit 1). This trajectory alone would make 
Asian Americans a force to be reckoned with and 
a priority for companies. Asian Americans are 
currently 6 percent of both the entire population 
and the employed workers in the United States.

These aggregate statistics obscure a huge amount 
of variation in the Asian American population, 
which includes three main subgroups—East 
Asians, Southeast Asians, and South Asians—
each of which encompasses great diversity. 
A number of factors, most prominently 
immigration, have shaped the population’s 
composition and its geographic concentration in 
a handful of US cities. Asian Americans tend to live 
and work in geographies with large populations 

and have higher levels of representation in major 
metropolitan areas.

These and other factors lead to diverse economic 
outcomes for Asian Americans. The disparity 
can be striking: while Asian Americans are 
overrepresented in high-wage occupations 
relative to their proportion of the US population, 
more than four million (one in five) live on less than 
200 percent of the federal poverty level. Some 
Asian Americans experience high levels of upward 
economic mobility, while others remain stuck at 
the bottom of the economic ladder. This diversity 
of economic outcomes is both a unique attribute of 
Asian Americans and a challenge. 

This pattern persists in the experiences of Asian 
Americans in the workplace. While often perceived 
as professionally successful, they continue to 
face barriers to advancement and often find their 
employers’ inclusion efforts ineffective. These

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengeschallenges are pervasive, particularly for people 
with intersectional identities: our research shows 
that gender, immigration status, and ethnicity all 
play a role in creating obstacles to pay parity and 
equitable representation and advancement.

In this report, we explore these topics in detail 
(see sidebar “Methodology and definitions”). 

Drawing on these insights, we then outline ways 
in which corporate leaders can better support 
Asian American workers. Understanding 
the varied and widespread challenges that Asian 
Americans face in corporate America is the first 
step to implementing more effective solutions. 
Let’s begin. 

Methodology and definitions

Throughout this report, we draw heavily from a few key sources of data:

1.  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) 2019 Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics 
data sets, which measure payroll-based employment and wages for nonfarm establishments1

2.  The US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, 2019 and 2020

3.  McKinsey’s Race in the Workplace study (2021 and 2022) and McKinsey and LeanIn.org’s 

Women in the Workplace study (2021), which draw from aggregate HR data and employee survey 
responses from companies across the United States

4.  Data compiled by Opportunity Insights, including detailed tax return data, combined with data 

from the American Community Survey and the US Census Bureau on economic mobility

5.  Qualitative interviews with Asian American workers on their workplace experience, conducted 

from April to June 2022

This report uses the BLS definition of employment status.2 Although we primarily use 2019 data for 
our analysis, we acknowledge the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the economy 
and the labor market.

In this report, we use the term “Asian American” to represent people of Asian descent who live and 
work in the United States. Several terms specific to Asian American are defined as follows:

1.  Asian American: people who are East Asian, Southeast Asian, or South Asian (see definitions 

below); for the purposes of this analysis, this data set does not include Asian Americans who are 
ethnically Hispanic or identify as more than one race

2.  East Asian: people who are ethnically Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Mongolian

3.  South Asian: people who are ethnically Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani, or 

Sri Lankan

4.  Southeast Asian: people who are ethnically Burmese, Cambodian, Filipino, Hmong, Indonesian, 

Laotian, Malaysian, Thai, or Vietnamese

5.  Other Asian: people who are Asian American who are categorized as “Other Asian” in 

the American Community Survey data or are of more than one Asian ethnicity

The stages of immigration and naturalization also come with specialized vocabulary:

1.  US-born: US citizens born in the United States

2.  Foreign-born resident: people who were born outside the US and who are either permanent 

residents or naturalized US citizens

3.  Foreign-born visa holder: other documented immigrants who are not permanent residents

A fast-growing, 
diverse workforce

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesOf the nearly 20 million Asian Americans in 
the United States, about nine million (6.1 percent) 
are part of the nearly 150 million-person US 
workforce. Asian Americans’ share of the overall 
US workforce is projected to increase; while 
the US population is forecast to expand just 
over 20 percent, from 330 million in 2020 
to 400 million in 2060, the Asian American 
population is estimated to almost double in that 
period.3 Immigration will have an outsize influence 
on the growth and composition of the Asian 
American population and its subgroups. 

These numbers—and this report—do not include 
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, who 
have distinct histories and challenges (see 
sidebar “Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders by 
the numbers”). 

Immigration has shaped the changing 
Asian American population

The Asian American population has always been 
diverse, and the impact of immigration means 
that the population’s composition is fluid. Asian 
Americans have consistently been about a quarter 
of immigrants into the United States every year 
since the mid-1990s.4 This influx of immigrants 
contradicts a common misconception of Asian 
Americans as a homogeneous group (see sidebar 
“The so-called monolith”). 

Three major subgroups make up the Asian 
American workforce, each with its own ethnic 
and cultural diversity (Exhibit 2): East Asians 
(who account for 35 percent of Asian American 
workers), Southeast Asians (also 35 percent), and 
South Asians (27 percent).

Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders by the numbers

This report does not discuss the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) population in depth. 
NHPIs are often combined with the Asian American population because many have origins in 
Asia. However, NHPIs differ substantially from the Asian American population in their history 
and current experience. Such factors contribute to different socioeconomic outcomes that merit 
a separate discussion.1

 — The US NHPI population was about 700,000 in 2020.2

 — It is projected to grow approximately 40 percent by 2060.3

 — There are about 240,000 NHPI workers, about 0.2 percent of the total US workforce.

 — Fifty-seven percent of NHPI workers (about 140,000) live in three states: California (29 percent), 

Hawaii (19 percent), and Washington (9 percent).

 — Sixty-nine percent of NHPI workers are US-born, 13 percent are foreign-born permanent 

residents and naturalized citizens, and 18 percent are foreign-born visa holders.

 — Ten percent of NHPIs have less than a high school education, 35 percent are high school 

graduates, 38 percent have completed some college or an associate degree, and 17 percent have 
a bachelor’s degree or higher.

 — Two-thirds of NHPI workers make less than $50,000 a year, and 26 percent make less than 

$30,000.

 — Sixteen percent of the NHPI population lives in poverty, higher than the US average of 12 percent.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesThe so-called monolith

Asian Americans are often spoken of as if they were a monolith—a single, uniform body. The Asian 
American population evolves over time: a mixture of residents with familial roots in Asia and US-born 
Asian Americans, the population is still growing and diversifying. For example, Indian Americans 
increased from 12 percent of the Asian American population in 1990 to 23 percent in 2020.1 

The implications of ever-shifting demographics for understanding Asian Americans are significant. 
A growing, ethnically mixed population defies a single characterization. Viewing Asian Americans as 
a uniform group and focusing on overall outcomes obscures the differing experiences and outcomes 
of subgroups. It’s time to recognize this diversity within the Asian American population.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesAbout three-quarters of Asian American workers 
are foreign-born.5 As of 2019, 86 percent of South 
Asian workers were foreign-born, compared with 
just over 70 percent of East Asian and Southeast 
Asian workers (Exhibit 3).6 

Historically, geopolitical events and government 
policies have shaped the composition of 
the Asian American workforce. Their immigration 
to the United States has historically included 
spikes in relation to significant economic and 
geopolitical events, such as the influx of Chinese 
workers during the Gold Rush, the building of 
the Transcontinental Railroad during the 19th 

century, and the arrival of significant numbers 
of refugees after armed conflicts in Asia in 
the 20th century.7 Over three decades following 
the Vietnam War and the Cambodian Civil War, 
more than 1.1 million Southeast Asian refugees 
settled in the United States.8 Asian American 
immigration has also been shaped by government 
policies. For example, the Chinese Exclusion Act 
and similar laws significantly restricted the number 
of Chinese immigrants to the United States 
for more than eight decades. The passage of 
the Immigration Act of 1965 replaced exclusionary 
rules dating back to 1924, and an update in 1990

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesset a flexible cap for family-based, employment-
based, and diversity immigrant visas.9

The combination of US immigration policy and 
private-sector needs has had a lasting impact on 
the size and composition of the Asian American 
population. For example, H-1B visas are reserved 
for highly educated foreign workers in specialty 
fields. As of 2019, South Asians accounted for half 
of all holders of H-1B visas (Exhibit 4). 

Asian Americans gravitate to 
economically vital regions

Asian Americans live in every region of the United 
States, but almost half reside in three states—

California, New York, and Texas—and are highly 
represented among the workforces in states in 
the West and the Northeast (Exhibit 5). In general, 
Asian Americans have settled in more densely 
populated geographies. Almost half of Asian 
American workers live in eight major metropolitan 
statistical areas (MSAs), and nearly one-third 
reside in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, 
and their surrounding areas (Exhibit 6).10 These 
eight MSAs are also projected to have generally 
higher job growth than other cities.

Diverse economic 
outcomes

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesMany factors, including educational attainment 
and immigration status, have a tremendous impact 
on an individual’s prospects for economic mobility 
and career advancement. In the aggregate, 
Asian Americans have high levels of educational 
attainment and rates of intergenerational 
upward economic mobility compared with the US 
population as a whole. But a look at the underlying 
distribution reveals a wide range of economic 
outcomes within the Asian American workforce, 
including high levels of representation in lower-
income occupations. Our analysis also revealed 
pay disparities between Asian American workers 
and their White counterparts in the same 
occupations. This pattern is more prominent in 
some higher-paying occupations. 

Encouraging outcomes across 
key metrics

We examined the outcomes of Asian Americans 
across educational attainment, economic mobility, 
and representation in higher-income occupations. 
These factors are interdependent and contribute 

to different experiences and prospects by 
subgroup. Elevated rates of educational 
achievement provide one explanation for 
the relatively increased levels of intergenerational 
economic mobility for Asian Americans and their 
representation in higher-income occupations. 

Educational attainment
As a group, Asian American workers have 
impressive levels of educational attainment: about 
54 percent have earned at least a bachelor’s 
degree, compared with 32 percent of the overall 
US population (Exhibit 7). However, educational 
attainment varies greatly by subgroup, from 
South Asian foreign-born noncitizens at the high 
end (78 percent with a bachelor’s or higher) to 
Southeast Asian foreign-born noncitizens at 
the low end (34 percent). 

Overall, even the children of Asian American

American children born to parents with less 
than a high school education earn at least 
a bachelor’s degree, compared with 12 percent 
of their White peers. These kinds of educational 
outcomes can contribute significantly to upward 
economic mobility.

Economic mobility
Overall, Asian Americans have high rates of 
intergenerational upward economic mobility. 
Significantly, one out of four Asian children born 
to families in the bottom quintile of household 
incomes joins the top quintile as an adult—more 
than twice the rate of their White counterparts. 
Nearly two-thirds of Asian Americans raised in 
families in the bottom quintile move into the middle 
quintile or higher (Exhibit 9).

Immigration is a significant factor in Asian 
American intergenerational mobility. Eighteen 
percent of Asian American children of US-born 

mothers in the lowest income quintile move into 
the highest income quintile as an adult, lower 
than the 27 percent overall for Asian Americans 
but higher than the 11 percent of White peers.11 
Consider Asian Americans who came to the United 
States as refugees. Although they might have 
arrived with significant education and work 
experience, many of those individuals had to start 
over from the bottom of the career and income 
ladder, which magnifies intergenerational gains in 
economic mobility. The interlocking determinants 
of Asian American economic mobility are not yet 
understood and warrant further study.

Economic diversity within the Asian 
American population

Although Asians Americans as a group experience 
poverty rates in line with the White population, 
data for specific Asian American subgroups 
reveal significant pockets of poverty (Exhibit 10).

Chinese, Hmong, Laotians, Nepalese, and 
Pakistanis have higher poverty rates than 
the US average of 12 percent. In fact, Chinese 
Americans account for almost one-third of all 
Asian Americans living in poverty.12 In all, 4.1 million 
Asian Americans live on less than 200 percent of 
the federal poverty level.13

Beyond poverty, incomes vary greatly by ethnicity 
and gender within the Asian American population, 
ranging from more than 2:1 from the highest 
median wages to the lowest across ethnicity to 
more than 3:1 when disaggregated by gender 
(Exhibit 11). The Pew Research Center has 
identified Asian Americans as having the highest 
income inequality among major US racial and 
ethnic groups.14

operators. The overrepresentation of Asian 
Americans in low-wage occupations puts them at 
greater financial risk from economic disruption. 
After the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, for 
example, unemployment rates for Asian American 
workers tripled from 3 percent in May 2019 to 
9 percent in May 2020.15

At the same time, Asian American workers 
(primarily foreign-born South Asian and East Asian 
workers) are also overrepresented in higher-wage 
technical fields such as software development and 
computer programming (Exhibit 12). Their US-born 
Asian counterparts are disproportionately 
represented in the medical profession.

in economic outcomes is most pronounced for 
foreign-born Asian American workers who are 
not permanent residents (Exhibit 13). Within this 
group, 12 percent of South Asian men earn less 
than $30,000 a year compared with 21 percent 
of South Asian women. Southeast Asian workers 
are much more likely than any other subgroup to 
earn less than $30,000 per year. The differences 
narrow for foreign-born Asian American workers 

who are permanent residents or naturalized 
citizens, and even more for US-born Asian 
Americans. Still, the gaps persist and have far-
reaching implications.

Although the Asian American population is 
extremely economically diverse, the perception 
of this group as the model minority persists (see 
sidebar “The model-minority myth”).

The model-minority myth

The idea of Asian Americans as a “model minority” has existed for decades. For example, a 1966 
article described Japanese Americans who had found socioeconomic success despite being 
marginalized.1 Asian Americans are perceived as successful, and the term is used to contrast them 
with other people of color. When applied to Asian Americans, the concept also extends to often 
harmful stereotypes that relate to upbringing (such as the “tiger mom”), genetic myths (for example, 
a predisposition to strength in STEM disciplines), and weakness or lack of interest in skills such 
as assertiveness, communication, and leadership (for example, hardworking but too soft spoken), 
particularly for East Asians. The model-minority myth is rarely seen as problematic, and it is even 
viewed as benefiting Asian Americans.2

These ideas pit racial and ethnic groups against one another.3 Although some Asian Americans have 
achieved favorable economic outcomes, the model-minority myth overlooks the experiences of many 
Asian Americans, caricatures a diverse spectrum of talent, obscures disparate outcomes among 
Asian Americans, and ignores many other determinants of those outcomes. In other words, a closer 
look at the data suggests that the model-minority concept, always divisive, is also faulty.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesEven when Asian Americans are 
in high-wage jobs, they experience 
income gaps compared with their 
White peers

Asian Americans are overrepresented in high-
wage occupations, with one in three earning 
more than $75,000 a year, compared with one 
in six White workers. Over the past few decades, 
the emphasis on high-skilled immigrants—which 
increased the percentage of the foreign-
born population with at least some college 
education from 17 percent in 1970 to 47 percent 
in 2010—has contributed to this distribution.16 
Almost three-quarters of Asian American 
workers are foreign-born, resulting in a high 
concentration of well-educated Asian Americans 
in lucrative occupations. 

These workers tend to be overrepresented in 
high-paying occupations such as physicians and 
pharmacists. As a result, Asian Americans fill 
14 percent of jobs in the occupations with a median 
wage of more than $100,000,17 more than twice 
their 6 percent share of the US workforce. 

Despite their overrepresentation in high-paying 
professions, Asian Americans are paid less than 
their White counterparts in three-quarters of 
occupations with a median wage of more than 
$100,000. On average, Asian Americans make 
$0.93 for every dollar earned by their White 
colleagues (Exhibit 14). The earnings gap is 
correlated with the shortfall in Asian American 
representation at higher-paying manager levels. 
Our research in the next section suggests 
contributing factors include a lack of inclusion and 
advancement in the workplace.

Advancement  
and inclusion in  
the workplace

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesAsian American employees face many 
challenges in moving up the career ladder. Their 
overall representation and share of promotions 
drop in senior corporate roles, a pattern that 
is magnified for Asian women. Further, Asian 
Americans report experiencing lower levels of 
inclusion, particularly in the dimensions of fairness 
and acceptance, compared with White employees. 
They are also less likely to perceive interventions 
such as sponsorship as effective in supporting 
career advancement compared with their 
peers. This sense of exclusion may be linked to 
the perception of Asians as perpetual foreigners—
outsiders in their own workplaces. Understanding 
the experiences of Asian American employees—
particularly subgroups that report more positive 
outcomes—can suggest a path forward.

‘Asians don’t count’: Obstacles 
to advancement

A look at the high-level numbers in the talent 
pipeline might lead corporate leaders to believe 
no serious issues exist when it comes to Asian 
American employees and their advancement 
in the workplace. McKinsey and LeanIn.org’s 
Women in the Workplace study, which sampled 
representation data from more than 400 large 
companies in 2021,18 found Asian Americans are 
represented at higher levels overall than in the US 
population, but their representation steadily 
declines from the entry level to higher levels of 
the corporate hierarchy.

Asian Americans at these companies 
account for more than 13 percent of entry-
level employees (individual contributors 
such as analysts, software engineers, and 

paralegals). But their representation declines 
at each management level: it drops to less than 
8 percent in the C-suite, with an especially 
notable decline in the representation of Asian 
women. Asian American women are particularly 
underrepresented at the vice president, senior 
vice president, and C-suite executive levels—at 
2.8, 2.5, and 1.8 percent, respectively (Exhibit 15). 

This lack of C-suite representation is also reflected 
in the largest companies in the United States. 
Among the Fortune 500 companies in 2022, only 
23 of the CEOs are Asian American, less than 
the expected 31 if the ranks were representative of 
Asian Americans’ share of the US workforce. 

The drop in representation at more senior levels 
is the result of lower-than-expected promotions 
for Asian American employees. For example, 
they represent 12 percent of senior managers 
in our sample but account for just 10 percent 
of the promotions from senior manager to vice 
president. The lower rate of promotions for Asian 
Americans is even more pronounced at higher 
levels. Asian Americans account for almost 
9 percent of senior vice presidents but just 
5 percent of the C-suite. Asian American women 
make up less than 1 percent of promotions into 
the C-suite. 

The advancement gaps show Asian American 
women are effectively penalized twice: for 
being a person of color and for being a woman. 
The share of promotions for Asian women is one 
for every two Asian men in the senior manager and 
vice president levels. That ratio drops to one for 
every six Asian men for promotions to the C-suite 
executive level. 

18  “Women in the Workplace 2021,” McKinsey and LeanIn.org, September 27, 2021.

Just the other day, I heard one of the leaders tell 
me that Asians don’t count in diversity because 
they are already doing well. I told him to name an 
Asian person in a senior role, and he couldn’t.

that only goes so far. No one’s ever

getting promoted. I don’t really see 
that many role models who look 
like me in leadership positions.

I can. And yet still I’m being 
held back because of who I am.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challenges‘I’m just used to working a lot 
harder’: Lower feelings of inclusion 
and fairness

Inclusion—the degree to which employees feel 
able to bring their full selves to work and make 
meaningful contributions—has a significant 
impact on metrics such as employee performance, 
retention, and job satisfaction.19 Many Asian 
Americans, even those who were born in 
the United States, feel they are perceived in 
the workplace as perpetual foreigners—an 
indication of social exclusion. This context makes 
inclusion at work even more critical (see sidebar 
“Asian Americans as perpetual foreigners”).

In a McKinsey survey of about 25,000 US 
employees, 30 percent of Asian Americans 
respondents said their race will make it harder 
to achieve their career goals (compared with 
21 percent of White respondents).20 East Asian 
respondents, Asian American women, and 
foreign-born employees are more likely to hold 
this opinion. Conversely, South Asian respondents 
have a similar perception as their White 

counterparts regarding their company’s actions 
to promote inclusion. Further data collection and 
analyses will be required to quantitatively assess 
how these differing perceptions are correlated 
with career advancement by subgroup. However, 
other data have shown a strong correlation 
between higher inclusion experience—particularly 
in dimensions of fairness—and perceptions of 
advancement support in general.21

Lower levels of inclusion

To further our understanding of Asian American 
employees and their feelings of inclusion in 
the workplace, the 2021 Race in the Workplace 
Survey collected data on employee perceptions 
across multiple dimensions of inclusion. Our 
analysis finds Asian American respondents 
report lower overall perceptions of inclusion 
in their companies compared with their White 
counterparts. Asian American respondents 
diverged most markedly from the assessments 
of White employees regarding their company’s 
acceptance and fairness practices (Exhibit 16). 

19     McKinsey Organization Blog, “Inclusion doesn’t happen by accident: Measuring inclusion in a way that matters,” blog entry by Diana 

Ellsworth, Drew Goldstein, and Bill Schaninger, February 16, 2021.

20     McKinsey surveyed US employees from 2020 to early 2021 about their workplace experiences of inclusion. The survey used 

McKinsey’s Inclusion Assessment to measure experiences of inclusion along six inclusion outcomes—acceptance, authenticity, 
belonging, camaraderie, fairness, and meaningful work—and 16 inclusion practices to capture how employees individually experience 
inclusion in the workplace and how they feel. Among the sample of 24,842 respondents, 2,178 self-identified as Asian American: 696 as 
East Asian, 933 as South Asian, and 549 as Southeast Asian. For more, see “Inclusion doesn’t happen by accident,” February 16, 2021.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesAsian Americans as perpetual foreigners

The United States is their home, but Asian Americans are often treated as permanent foreigners—
even those who are US-born. Although three-quarters of Asian Americans are foreign-born, many of 
them have set down roots in the United States; almost half of all immigrants from Asia and the Pacific 
Islands have been here for more than 20 years.1

The dark side of the perpetual-foreigner stereotype has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic 
with an escalation in the number of violent crimes committed against Asian Americans. These 
violent experiences, combined with both subtle and overt instances of social exclusion, make Asian 
Americans more likely to feel less included at work.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesCreating a safe, supportive 
environment for all employees

Asian Americans are less likely than their White 
peers to feel that their companies allow them to 
be authentic.22 These experiences make it difficult 
for them to bring their full selves to work. While 
Asian American employees overall have lower 
perceptions of acceptance than White employees, 
East Asian and Southeast Asian employees 
have an even larger inclusion gap when it comes 
to how their companies recognize different 
cultural traditions. These gaps are correlated with 
the perpetual foreigner perception—what should 
feel authentic ends up emphasizing feelings of 
being an outsider (Exhibit 17).

A workplace that isn’t a meritocracy

Compared with their White counterparts, Asian 
Americans also report their workplaces are less 

fair and meritocratic23: they have worse access 
to resources and opportunities to advance (for 
example, relationships with senior leaders and 
coaching), and some employees perceive their 
companies’ recognition and rewards are not 
based on objective processes. Similar to their 
feelings of acceptance, East Asian and Southeast 
Asian respondents feel the difference in fairness 
more acutely. When asked if their companies 
provide all employees with the mentorship and 
coaching to be successful, only 27 percent 
of East Asian employees and 32 percent of 
Southeast Asian employees agreed, compared 
with 44 percent of White employees. So even 
though employees in general often perceive low 
levels of fairness,24 Asian Americans feel it even 
more. The implications for career advancement 
and motivation—not just the quality of workplace 
experience—are significant (Exhibit 18).

22  For the purposes of the survey, self-expression is defined as “creates a space for employees to express themselves in ways that are 

personally meaningful.” Protective mechanisms is defined as “discourages inappropriate, disrespectful, or biased behaviors at work and 
provides employees a safe way to report such behaviors.”

23  For the purposes of the survey, meritocracy is defined as “creates objective and consistent processes for personnel decisions and 

merit-based rewards.” Resource accessibility is defined as “provides all employees with equal access to information, opportunities, and 
relationships they need to be successful.”

Lower levels of inclusion at 
senior levels

One promising sign is that frontline and corporate 
entry-level Asian American employees, on 
average, perceive the same or even greater 
levels of inclusion as their White peers. However, 
senior-level Asian American respondents—senior 
managers and VPs—report significantly lower 
feelings of inclusion, particularly when it comes to 
perceptions of fairness (for example, meritocracy 
and impartial treatment) than do their White peers. 
Like overall trends of perceived inclusion, these 
gaps at the more senior levels are amplified for 
East Asian and Southeast Asian employees. 

A lack of sponsorship for Asian 
American employees in senior roles

Sponsors—organizational leaders who create 
opportunities and advocate for someone to 
grow and advance at their organization—are 
an important part of inclusion in the workplace 
and have proved effective in supporting 
advancement.25 About half of Asian American 

employees report having at least one sponsor, 
similar to the rate of White employees (Exhibit 19). 

However, the story changes when we consider 
sponsorship by job level. For corporate entry-
level employees and managers, 51 percent of 
Asian American employees reported having 
sponsors, four percentage points higher than 
White employees. But for senior managers and 
above, 52 percent of Asian American employees 
reported having sponsors, ten percentage points 
lower than White employees. This disparity 
manifests in the much higher percentage of 
senior White employees who report having 
two or more sponsors. This pattern suggests 
leadership support and advocacy are greater for 
White employees than Asian employees at more 
senior levels. 

Even more telling is the perception of sponsor 
effectiveness among more senior Asian American 
employees. Asian Americans employees at 
the corporate-entry and manager level report 
a similar level of effectiveness as their White 
counterparts regarding the impact of sponsors 

25  For more, see Alexis Krivkovich and Marie-Claude Nadeau, “The link between sponsorship and risk-taking for women in financial 

services,” McKinsey, May 22, 2019.

in creating opportunity. But at more senior levels, 
Asian American employees’ perception of sponsor 
effectiveness drops 14 percentage points, while 
the perception among their White peers drops just 
two percentage points. 

The combination of the two dynamics—lower 
feelings of inclusion and lower sponsorship among 
Asian employees relative to White employees—
correlates with the divergent rates of promotion 
for these groups at more senior levels of 
the organization.

At a certain level publicly, 
my company wants to 
show that they promote 
and value leaders of

point, I think they still 
aren’t totally there yet.

Supporting Asian 
Americans at work

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesAsian Americans are projected to make up 
a greater share of the workforce in the next 
40 years, so it will be increasingly important 
for companies to support these workers. Our 
assessment of different groups within the Asian 
American population reveals significant disparities 
in workplace experience, career advancement, 
and economic outcomes. 

Much work remains to be done to craft effective 
policies and programs. We don’t have all 
the answers yet, but we hope that this report’s 
analysis spurs constructive and creative action. 
To boost inclusion and equity for Asian American 
workers, employers can collect and analyze 
granular data, support Asian American workers 
at critical moments, address inclusion challenges, 
create effective sponsorship opportunities, 
and make Asian American issues part of 
corporate responsibility.

Collect more granular data about 
Asian American workers

We have established the diversity of the Asian 
American population and its experiences within 
the workplace. Data are essential to help decision 

makers understand the experiences, needs, and 
challenges of groups within this population. 

Of course, many private employers in the United 
States have a legal obligation to submit workforce 
demographic data by race and ethnicity to 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.26 
But these submissions aggregate all Asian 
American employees into one category,27 and 
many employers do not take the extra step of 
collecting information on subgroups. Given 
the growing Asian American demographic, this 
more general category lacks detail about ethnicity 
that could inform diversity, equity, and inclusion 
(DEI) efforts to bridge the diverse experiences of 
Asian American workers.28

Employers, public statistics agencies, and 
researchers alike could consider collecting 
data that are disaggregated by ethnicity. 
The East Asian, Southeast Asian, and South 
Asian categories offer a basic starting point. 
Oversampling smaller populations may also 
help secure a large enough data set to produce 
accurate analysis. This approach can also be used 
to better understand and meet the needs of other 
underrepresented groups. 

26  “2021 EEO-1 Component 1 Data Collection,” US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accessed August 23, 2022.
27  Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander is a separate category.
28  For research purposes, public statistical agencies and scholars could collect data that is disaggregated by ethnicity. Oversampling 

smaller populations could also help secure a large enough data set to produce accurate analysis.

When people look at 
us, they don’t really 
see a leader. They see 
someone smart, good with 
numbers, but not someone 
who can lead a team.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesSupport Asian American workers at 
critical moments

Granular data can help to inform corporate leaders 
about the experiences of Asian Americans at 
critical moments in their professional journeys, 
such as recruitment, evaluation, promotion, 
and the identification of mentors and sponsors. 
Cultural differences for Asian Americans—and 
within the Asian American community—have 
been linked to differences in advancement 
in the workplace.29 To help address lower 
perceptions of fairness, companies should 
continue working to eliminate implicit bias (for 
example, traditional ideas of leadership qualities) 
from job interviews and evaluations.

Address inclusion challenges for 
Asian American employees

Societal challenges are often carried into 
the workplace, and the harmful idea of Asian 
Americans as perpetual foreigners, even in their 
country, communities, and workplaces, can 
be quietly damaging. Our research across US 
companies uncovered disparate experiences 
within the Asian American employee population 

as well; women and immigrants have generally 
worse workplace experiences, and East Asian 
and Southeast Asian employees view dimensions 
of workplace fairness much more negatively 
than South Asian employees do. Disaggregating 
workplace engagement surveys can reveal 
hidden problems.

Developing programs that educate employees 
on how to identify and address inappropriate or 
biased behavior could help to improve inclusion 
for Asian American workers, including guarding 
against bias in workplace conversations. 
Recognizing diverse traditions and habits, 
including cultural celebrations and holidays, can 
be one avenue to help Asian American employees 
feel comfortable bringing their whole authentic 
selves to work.

Another potential action to improve inclusion 
is establishing and supporting Asian American 
employee resource groups (ERGs). These groups 
can provide an open space for discussions about 
the challenges faced by specific ethnicities and 
intersectionalities (for example, gender and 
immigration background), while celebrating 
and educating leaders and colleagues about

positions in the United States,” PNAS, 2020, Volume 117, Number 9.

I do think that my cultural 
upbringing makes it more 
difficult to feel comfortable 
advocating for myself. It’s a 
confidence issue: I’m almost 
afraid that I’ll get fired.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesthe individual cultures of Asian Americans. These 
groups can also help organizations collect, 
examine, and interpret data about Asian American 
employees, adding context to findings in areas 
such as representation and promotion rates.

Create effective sponsorship 
opportunities for Asian 
American workers

Effective sponsorship is critical for career 
advancement, including providing pathways 
for employees who are either disinterested or 
considering leaving their jobs. Sponsorship, 
which for Asian American employees tends to 
decrease both in engagement and effectiveness 
at higher levels in corporate America, requires 
active advocacy. Companies with programs that 
assign sponsors to employees may find these 
connections to be less effective. Providing 
opportunities for employees to make informal 
connections that could turn into sponsorships or 
giving sponsors the tools to better advocate for 
their colleagues could lead to better outcomes 
for employees.

Address Asian American issues as 
part of corporate responsibility

Public data show that even though Asian 
Americans experience poverty at similar rates as 
White Americans, the majority of Asian American 
ethnic groups are actually more likely than the US 
population to live in poverty. Yet because some 
aggregate statistics show Asian Americans 
achieving favorable economic outcomes overall, 
these groups can be neglected. Settling as 
refugees, for example, often means completely 
starting over in the new country, making these 
populations more economically vulnerable 
and fragile.

Many companies already have a presence in their 
communities and engage in outreach as part of 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
efforts. As organizations evaluate how to address 
poverty and social inequities in their broader 
communities, they could ensure Asian Americans, 
including their unique needs and concerns, are 
part of the conversation to guide philanthropic 
and other efforts. Countering the escalating 
incidence of anti-Asian hate is another area in 
which corporations could contribute. Addressing 

When it comes to networking, 
there’s a lot of culture and 
kind of ‘old boys club’ type of 
ways of connecting, whether 
it’s golf or vacationing in the 
same spots. It’s just not as 
common for an immigrant, 
and it’s not as relatable.

Asian American workers: Diverse outcomes and hidden challengesAsian American issues as part of the corporate 
social responsibility agenda could not only 
mobilize Asian American employees to participate 
(thereby improving inclusion) but also educate 
workers about the Asian American population and 
its subgroups.

Taking the proper steps to recognize, understand, 
and support Asian Americans employees doesn’t 
require companies to start from square one. Many 
of the initiatives and platforms already exist, 

but they need to be recalibrated to the needs 
of Asian Americans—both as a whole and for 
specific subgroups. The effort must begin 
with an acknowledgment of the opportunity to 
do better and a commitment to ensure Asian 
American employees feel more connected in 
the workplace.

This burgeoning segment of the US workforce, 
overlooked for too long, is poised to become 
an even greater asset. Companies must take 
actions now to unlock the full potential of 
Asian Americans.
