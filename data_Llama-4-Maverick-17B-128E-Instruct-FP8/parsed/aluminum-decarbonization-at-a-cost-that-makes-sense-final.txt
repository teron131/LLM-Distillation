Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SensePART 1

Introduction

Infinitely recyclable, immensely strong, lightweight, and 
malleable: aluminum is the metal that makes modern 
economies tick. With uses ranging from beverage cans to cars, 
airplanes, and solar panels, it is also extremely versatile. There 
is only one real problem: while the metal itself is sustainable, 
its production usually is not. In fact, the aluminum industry 
accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) 
emissions. Mostly due to its high energy use, the aluminum 
industry emits around 1.1 billion metric tons (t) of GHGs a year.1 

The aluminum industry as outlined in Mission Possible 
Pathway’s (MPP) Sector Transition strategy and the 
International Aluminium Institute’s (IAI) 1.5° work together can 
deliver a 1.5° pathway–aligned net-zero sector. One of the core 
challenges to achieving this, however, is that transforming the 
aluminum sector to a low-carbon sector will require upgrading 
refining and smelting assets and making significant investments 
in low-carbon power. 

PAGE 5

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SenseThe investment case for decarbonizing each individual refinery 
or smelter will be determined by local circumstances, and local 
power availability and local policy arrangements will be critical. 

This report and open-sourced investment model outlines the 
levers that could close the finance gap. Users can generate 
their own investment case using the underlying analysis from 
MPP’s Sector Transition strategy with analytical support from 
McKinsey’s Sustainability and Basic Materials Practices to 
understand what additional levers from financers, customers, 
and policy makers may be essential for each investment case.  

How stakeholders can help 
One of the challenges to aluminum decarbonization is that 
best currently available fossil-fuel-based technologies have a 
net present value greater than green alternatives. Overcoming 
these economic obstacles and risks will require collaborative 
action among stakeholders. Banks, investors, policy makers, 
and end customers will each have an important role to play.

The finance sector. Decarbonization won’t be cheap. 
Cumulative investment of approximately $1 trillion across the 
primary production value chain will be needed to deliver a net-
zero sector or a 1.5° pathway. The majority of this investment 
will be needed in power supply and smelters.2 Aluminum 
producers will need to retire fossil-fuel-based production 
and make new investments in low-carbon alternatives, even 
though these are likely to have a lower return on capital and 
contain some technology and implementation risks. Financial 
institutions have the capability to mitigate some of these 
risks and shift cash flows toward green investments. Given 
the generally high levels of debt in the aluminum industry, 
improved interest rates for low-carbon investments and new 
products such as green loans or bonds used exclusively for 
climate-friendly projects could be key enablers. Additionally, 
banks could incorporate climate considerations into their 
lending decisions, such as those developed by the Center for 
Climate-Aligned Finance (CAF). Financial partnerships designed 
to support sustainable investment already exist, such as the 
Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which brings together banks 
which represent 40 percent of global banking assets.

Governments and policy makers. Governments play a 
critical role in aluminum decarbonization not only because 
the government is a relevant end customer of particular 
aluminum products but also because aluminum is a strategic 
metal for the energy transition, raising governments as 
strategic investors in aluminum production and aluminum 
decarbonization. Governments have several tools to provide 
incentives for aluminum decarbonization. Government grants 
to aluminum producers can help offset some of the costs 
of green investment, while carbon contracts for difference 
(CCfDs) bring the operational costs of decarbonized operations 
in line with those of fossil-fuel-based technology. However, 
our analysis shows that the greatest impact to the economics 
of decarbonization could come from carbon pricing, whether 
through trading schemes or carbon taxes. This could spur 
investment in green aluminum and enable the economics of the 
industry’s net-zero transition.

Customers. Aluminum users will likely have an important role 
to play in creating demand and helping shift the industry toward 
decarbonization. This could including paying what we estimate 
to be a 5 to 10 percent premium for green aluminum or by 
making firm advance commitments to purchase it. Such offtake 
agreements could be negotiated before a factory is constructed 
or begins operations, or before major retrofits are undertaken, 
significantly cutting investment risk. For manufacturers that 
have set decarbonization goals for their sourcing and supply 
chains, such premiums may be worth paying. Apple, for 
instance, has announced that its new iPhone SE will use zero-
carbon aluminum produced from hydropower in Quebec.3

Rising demand for low-carbon products is pushing the 
aluminum industry away from the carbon-intensive processes 
that have dominated production for the past 135 years. At the 
same time, the dynamics of a warming planet are evidence 
that change needs to happen as fast as possible. To make the 
green transition a reality, players throughout the aluminum 
value chain need to seize the moment, work together to support 
a purposeful transition, and recreate the industry for the 
demands of the coming decades.

PART II

Levers to accelerate  
decarbonization

The intensity of GHG emissions associated with alumina 
refining and aluminum smelting leaves the industry with little 
choice but to seek out the most efficient way to decarbonize. 
However, while players across the value chain have been 
taking steps to align with a 1.5° pathway, more planning and 
investment are required to significantly reduce emissions 
associated with aluminum production.

To explore the potential for change, Mission Possible 
Partnership’s Aluminium for Climate team, with analytical 

support from McKinsey’s Basic Materials Insights and 
Sustainability Practices, has developed an open-access, 
open-source investment model for alumina and aluminum 
plant archetypes. The user-friendly model creates a twin 
lens on costs and decarbonization options for Scopes 1, 2, 
and 3 emissions. The model is structured to allow alumina 
refineries, aluminum producers, OEMs, upstream players, 
finance players, policy makers, and end-industry users to input 
their assumptions about decarbonizing alumina refineries and 
aluminum smelting, and to compare investment scenarios 

PAGE 7

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes Sensewith best available technologies (BAT). Users can select a series 
of inputs for investment scenarios and run multiple levers to 
reduce the net-present-value (NPV) gap versus ongoing or 
BAT operations. The model aims to provide the latest thinking 
related to the key technologies and processes, evaluate the 
different options, and inspire decision makers on the options and 
prerequisites of deploying these technologies in the real world.

2.1 

Investment risks 

The significant investment required to decarbonize the aluminum 
industry could expose companies and stakeholders to a range of 
risks. These include market risks, specifically threats to market 
capitalizations, as well as credit and liquidity risks. There could 
also be risks associated with executing decarbonization projects 
and the impacts of policy and regulation (see sidebar “Potential 
risks associated with aluminum decarbonization”). The industry 
will need to manage all of these risks to successfully accelerate 
the decarbonization agenda.

A basic element of risk mitigation strategies will be dedicated 
to long-term planning, based on an understanding of all 
available and economically reasonable decarbonization 
pathways. In addition, there are various financial, policy, and

demand levers that may create a more favorable environment 
for investment (see sidebar “Finance and policy levers to likely 
derisk investments”). 

Potential risks associated with aluminum decarbonization

Market risk

An aluminum producer’s shareholder value deteriorates due to a decarbonization investment that carries a lower return on 
capital compared with business-as-usual investments.

Credit risk

An aluminum producer contracts significant debt to undergo decarbonization investments with high uncertainty on future 
cash flows and potential for credit downgrading.

Liquidity risk

An aluminum producer has a perceived or actual inability to meet its liabilities due to a cash flow drain from investments in 
decarbonization efforts, threatening its financial position or even existence.

Technical and execution risk

An aluminum producer invests in a technology or project design that is unproven or that lacks internal tools, systems, 
processes, and people to successfully develop it, turning investment into stranded asset.

Political and regulatory risk

Trade barriers recently installed in the European Union, such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism, have dramatically 
changed the prospects of high-CO2e investment exports.

PAGE 8

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SenseFinance and policy levers to likely derisk investments

The decarbonization of the aluminum value chain needs to be a concerted effort between financial institutions, political 
institutions, producers, buyers, intermediaries and equipment providers. To successfully meet a 1.5°C scenario, a set of levers 
could help to stimulate investment in ultra-low-carbon aluminum production.

Finance levers

•  Financial institutions will likely be part of the decarbonization of the aluminum value chain to reduce their financed 
emissions and at the same time mitigate climate risk by decreasing interest rates, increasing loan duration, or 
increasing loan to value of loans for players’ decarbonization efforts through issuing: 

 ◦ green loans 

 ◦ green bonds 

 ◦

 ◦

transition bonds 

sustainability-linked loans or bonds1 

Policy levers

•  Setting up carbon prices or taxes. These can take multiple forms, such as locally regulated taxes, exchange-traded 
emissions systems like those currently installed in several parts of the world, and fees on imports, such as the cross-
border adjustment mechanism that will be implemented in the European Union. 

•  Offering government grants. For example, a CA $1.8 billion grant (US $1.4 billion) from the Canadian government is 

making possible an ArcelorMittal investment in the steel industry to convert a blast furnace to an electric-arc furnace, 
resulting in a CO2e emissions reduction of three million metric tons (or 60 percent emissions reduction). The Canadian 
government has also provided some support to Alcoa and Rio Tinto for development of the ELYSIS technology. 

•  Developing carbon contracts for difference (CCfD). For example, Germany is currently considering providing €43 
billion funding for CCfD for use in heavy industry (for example, steel, cement, and chemicals). This will be a ten-year 
agreement resulting in an offset in CO2e emissions of 20 million metric tons per year. A similar CCfD scheme has 
been implemented in the United Kingdom to accelerate the renewable-energy transition and has already supported 
16 GW of low-carbon electricity. 

Demand levers

•  Reaching offtake agreements. Offtake agreements often help secure funds for decarbonization, reducing the 

investment risk. Buyers and sellers can reach an agreement to purchase a defined quantity of low-carbon-footprint 
product at a predefined price or at the cost of the production price. 

•  Accepting green premiums. Due to a lack of balance between supply and demand for low-carbon footprint products, a 
time-bound green premium can emerge, allowing for supply-side flexibility and coverage of the decarbonization cost.

PAGE 9

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SenseAll of the levers—on the financial, policy, and demand side—are 
routes to mitigating and reducing the risks associated with 
investment. Ideally, they would be combined in various ways so 
that they are mutually reinforcing. A hybrid approach is likely to 
be optimal, because no single intervention will be sufficient to 
unlock sectorwide investment.

Here we consider each category of lever in detail and outline 
steps that leading players are already taking.

2.1.1  Financial levers

A significant element of the industry’s transition will be a 
committed program of investment. This reflects the wider 
reality that the net-zero transition will demand average annual 
spending of $9.2 trillion across industries by 2050.

Decarbonization of the aluminum industry will require 
investment in the industry’s operations as well as in the power 
and recycling sectors. In parallel, investment in fossil-fuel-
based production will need to decline rapidly. To facilitate this 
process, the finance sector will need to play a critical role, 
supported by three key levers: 

• 

improvement in terms for low-carbon investments, 
through interest rates, debt tenure, or other conditions 

•  bringing new finance products to market and tailoring 

finance to the particular combination of risks inherent in 
low-carbon products 

•  aligning the climate objectives of finance providers and 
alumina and aluminum producers through principles of 
credit provision associated with pathways to 1.5ºC 

Finance providers can also make strategic contributions, 
leveraging investment expertise across the value chain to take 
a holistic approach to system change. They can apply lessons 
learned in other sectors and identify how different projects can 
be effectively integrated. 

Improved terms. The terms for investment in low-carbon 
aluminum will be shaped by the mix of investment risks. As 
capital providers better understand decarbonization levers and 
project risk profiles, and as offtake commitments are made, 
more capital is likely to flow to green and brown-to-green 
investments. Capital providers that proactively work to make 
a product relevant to a low-emission future will lower their 
transition risk relative to their peers.

A range of financial instruments. Low-carbon aluminum projects 
present a different mix of risks than traditional aluminum 
projects, so tools that have been specifically designed for the 
green-finance market are likely to be most useful:

•  Green loans are any type of loan instrument exclusively 
applied to finance or refinance new or existing eligible 
green projects, in whole or in part. 

•  Green bonds are bonds whose raised funds are applied 
exclusively to projects and activities that promote 
climate or other environmental sustainability purposes. 
According to the Climate Bonds Initiative, nearly $2 
trillion in green bonds have been issued since market 
inception in 2007.4 

•  Transition bonds are bonds whose funds are applied 
exclusively to new and existing projects that support 
corporate climate strategies. 

•  Sustainability-linked loans and bonds embed “sustain-
ability performance targets” and trigger a reduction in 
the cost of debt if certain KPIs are achieved. Unlike green 
or sustainable bonds, funds raised with this instrument 
are not tagged to a specific use but are for general cor-
porate purposes.

The Loan Syndications & Trading Association (LSTA) has 
defined parameters associated with sustainability-linked 
lending to support sustainable economic activity.5 Its 
framework consists of five components: selection of KPIs to 
assess sustainability and core business strategy; calibration 
of sustainability performance targets (SPTs), representing 
an improvement over industry standard operations; loan 
characteristics, dependent on the borrower meeting SPTs 
and KPIs; reporting at least annually to allow monitoring of 
performance of SPTs and KPIs; and verification of performance 
against SPTs and KPIs, at least annually. A limited number of 
institutions have explored sustainability-linked lending, but this 
tool can also support decarbonization.

“Low-carbon aluminum projects 

present a different mix of risks than 

traditional aluminum projects, so 

tools that have been specifically 

designed for the green-finance 

market are likely to be most useful.”

PAGE 10

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SenseAligning climate objectives of finance providers and alumina 
and aluminum producers. Lending practices will likely evolve to 
meet the investment demands of the 1.5°C goal. This will mean 
boosting investment in low-carbon aluminum but also reducing 
investment in high-carbon projects. This kind of approach is 
encapsulated in the Poseidon Principles, a global framework for 
responsible ship finance that integrates climate considerations 
in lending decisions.6 In aluminum, the Center for Climate-
Aligned Finance (CAF) is working with three banking leads, 
leading aluminum producers, and partner organizations focused 
on sustainable finance to ensure that the objectives of firms in 
the aluminum sector and their financial partners are aligned 
and actionable.7

Bringing the community together. To meet net-zero targets, 
financial institutions need to work together to provide 
capital to both greenfield and retrofit projects. These kinds 
of partnerships are already developing. For example, the 
Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which brings together banks that 
are committed to aligning their lending and investments 
with net-zero emissions by 2050, currently represents 40 
percent of global banking assets. The Glasgow Financial 
Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) has more than 450 members, 
representing $130 trillion of assets. GFANZ members will use 
science-based guidelines to reach net-zero emissions across 
all emissions scopes by 2050, as well as 2030 interim targets. 
GFANZ members report on their progress annually, including 
disclosures in line with the guidelines drafted by the Task Force 
for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

2.1.2  Policy levers

Governments have a key role to play in facilitating investment 
in decarbonization solutions as well as in promoting innovation. 
Mechanisms such as carbon pricing (through trading schemes 
or carbon taxes) show that policy can have a significant impact 
on corporate behaviors, while trade-based initiatives such as 
the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 
use import duties to encourage both domestic and overseas 
producers to switch to cleaner technologies. Policy instruments 
such as carbon contracts for difference can create stable access 
to competitively priced clean electricity. 

Government grants could offset some of the cost of investment. 
In the steel industry, CA $1.8 billion (US $1.3 billion)8 in federal 
and provincial grants and loans enabled ArcelorMittal to convert 
a blast furnace to an electric arc furnace.9 The conversion will 
lead to three million metric tons (or 60 percent) of emissions 
reduction.10 The Canadian government has also provided 
support to Alcoa and Rio Tinto for research and development—
for example, in relation to ELYSIS inert-anode technology, 
which promises to eliminate all direct GHGs from the traditional 

smelting process. 11 In Australia, Alcoa received support to test 
electric calcination, with AU $8.6 million (US $6.4 million) from 
the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and AU $1.7 
million (US $1.3 million) from Western Australia’s Clean Energy 
Future Fund (CEFF).12

Carbon contracts for difference (CCfDs) are a policy lever to 
help bring the operational costs of decarbonized operations 
in line with those of conventional technology (Exhibit 
1). CCfDs typically offset the difference between the market 
price for emissions allowances (carbon price) and the cost of 
operating decarbonized technology. A price is selected for the 
decarbonized technology to level operational costs with those 
of conventional technology. When the operational costs exceed 
this level, the state pays the difference. Conversely, if the 
operational cost is lower than the agreed cost, the decarbonized 
facility pays the difference. 

While no entity in the aluminum industry has yet used CCfDs, 
Germany is considering providing €43 billion to support 
their application in heavy industry. The vision is a ten-year 
agreement that will result in an offset of 20 million metric 
tons of CO2e emissions per year.13 A similar scheme has been 
implemented in the United Kingdom, supporting 16 GW of low-
carbon electricity (enough to power 15 million homes).14

2.1.3  Demand levers

End users can play a role in supporting green investments by 
paying more or making firm commitments to purchase. In the 
former case, private- or public-sector buyers can pay a green 
premium when carbon emissions are below a certain threshold, 
such as less than 0.1 tCO2e/t of alumina or below 4.0 tCO2e/t 
of aluminum. According to Fastmarkets, a cross-commodity 
price reporting agency, green premiums have reached about 
1 percent of the London Metal Exchange (LME) price, but they 
could climb to 5 to 10 percent.15 

“One of the challenges to 

decarbonization is that the current 

best available technology often 

has an NPV that is greater than the 

green-investment scenario.”

Offtake agreements are arrangements between buyers and 
sellers to purchase a quantity of product at a defined price. 
They may be negotiated before a factory is constructed or 
begins operating, as well as for major retrofits, significantly 
cutting investment risk.

To model some likely combinations of levers and technology, 
this paper presents five scenarios that would either create a 
green premium or support demand.19 These combinations of 
levers are illustrative; the user can explore the benefits of these 
scenarios through the supporting tool.

Many companies are working hard to decarbonize their 
aluminum supply chains. Apple, for example, is targeting net-
zero climate impact across all business functions by 203016 
and has announced that its new iPhone SE will use net-zero 
aluminum produced by ELYSIS.17 

“Inert-anode technology can have 

2.2  Combining levers: Five scenarios

similar electricity intensity as the 

Hall-Héroult process or as much 

as 20 percent higher, so smelters 

that rely on green electricity are 

suitable to retrofit with inert-anode 

technology.”

One of the challenges to decarbonization is that the current 
best available technology often has an NPV that is greater 
than that of the green-investment scenario. Moreover, no 
single lever will be sufficient to support aluminum industry 
decarbonization on its own. The most likely scenario is that 
companies will adopt a mix of levers that facilitate either green 
investment or demand-side drivers. By combining levers, 
stakeholders can close the NPV gap for low-carbon investments 
(achieving a green premium) and secure cash flows. In general, 
finance will play a relatively minor role in bridging the NPV gap, 
particularly in cases with less capital expenditure, but it will 
play a more significant role where capital investment is more 
dominant—for example, in inert-anode retrofits.18

PAGE 12

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes Sense2.2.1  Scenario 1: Retrofit of smelter in  

captive plant in the Middle East

Smelting operations in the Middle East have seven million 
metric tons of aluminum capacity, while electricity is mostly 
derived from natural-gas combined-cycle (NGCC) plants. NGCC 
is an advanced technology that improves the efficiency of 
natural gas. The scenario considers retrofitting the smelter and 
natural-gas facility with CCS. 

•  Best available technology: existing smelter with captive 

gas 

•  Green investment: retrofit CCS on smelter and NG power 

plant

Retrofitting a smelter in the Middle East with CCS would 
produce a negative NPV of about $3.3 billion (Exhibit 2). Setting 

up a carbon price for both smelter and electricity generation 
(about $60 per tCO2e as a starting price) and a CCfD for ten 
years (worth $150 million a year) could improve the investment 
NPV to offset the increasing operating costs of CCS. Since 
green-investment operating expenditure is higher than BAT, 
finance levers would have a smaller impact than demand and 
policy levers, which would attenuate the increased operating 
expenditure from CCS.

In this specific illustrative combination of levers, the finance 
levers make a relatively small contribution to reducing the 
NPV difference. This is for two reasons. First, significant CCS 
capital expenditures are required to retrofit the smelter and 
the natural-gas power plant. Second, there are increased 
operating expenditures for running the CCS plants, as 
compared with ongoing operations, where a reduction of 
interest rate and increase of loan duration are not enough to 
bridge the NPV difference.

Policy levers could improve the investment case for retroﬁtting a 
smelter in a captive power plant in the Middle East.

2.2.2  Scenario 2: Retrofit inert anode on  

smelter in Europe 

Europe’s customers are likely the most advanced globally 
in pursuing decarbonization targets, which is encouraging 
smelters to further decarbonize.20

•  Best available technology: existing smelter with captive 

hydro 

•  Green investment: retrofit inert anode 

Inert-anode technology can have similar electricity intensity as 
the Hall-Héroult process or as much as 20 percent higher, so 

smelters that rely on green electricity are suitable to retrofit 
with inert-anode technology. Because there is uncertainty 
around the exact electricity intensity of this solution, we have 
expanded the analysis to two scenarios: a 15 percent increase 
over the current average (16 MWh/t of aluminum), and with 
equivalent consumption to current Hall-Héroult (13.8 MWh/t of 
aluminum). Retrofitting a smelter in Europe with inert anodes 
would have a negative NPV of about $1.2 billion when assuming 
electricity intensity of 16 MWh/t of aluminum (Exhibit 3). Under 
the second scenario (Hall Héroult–equivalent consumption), 
a combination of lower electricity intensity, a green premium, 
and the carbon price would be sufficient to make investment in 
inert-anode technology NPV neutral (Exhibit 4).

Green premiums and CO2 prices may be required for inert-anode 
retroﬁt to have equal net present value in the European Union.

smelter in China 

China has the largest aluminum smelting capacity and one of 
the largest aluminum CO2e footprints, and it is deploying the 
most solar, off-shore wind, and nuclear energy capacity.21 Our 
analysis thus focuses on inert anodes powered by a green grid. 
Given the uncertainty around the electricity intensity of inert-
anode technology, we use two scenarios.

•  Best available technology: existing smelter with captive 

coal 

•  Green investment: retrofit inert anode plus grid

Retrofitting a smelter in China with inert-anode technology 
and connecting it to the grid would have a negative NPV of 
$1.2 billion when assuming inert-anode electricity intensity of 
16 MWh/t of aluminum (Exhibit 5). If similar intensity to Hall-
Héroult is assumed, the negative NPV would be about $400 
million (Exhibit 6). Since the base case is a coal-fired smelter, 
policy levers applied to electricity generation could have a 
significant impact.

Policy levers such as CO2 pricing are needed to enable investments 
in inert anodes (electricity intensity of 16 Mwh/t) in China.

with MVR

Since the base case is an NG-based calciner, policy levers 
applied to heavy emitters could have a significant impact.

Oceania is the second-largest producer of alumina, and the 
Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has deployed 
a number of projects focused on decarbonizing alumina 
refineries. This has supported the development of MVR retrofit 
in digestion and hydrogen-calciner development. The scenario 
envisages retrofitting an Oceania refinery with MVR for 
digestion steam and hydrogen-fired calciner.

•  Best available technology: existing refinery utilizing gas 

•  Green investment: retrofit MVR and hydrogen (H2) 

calcination

Retrofitting a refinery in Oceania with MVR and green-hydrogen 
calciner would have a negative NPV of $1 billion (Exhibit 7).

2.2.5  Scenario 5. Retrofit South America  

refinery with electric boiler for    
digestion steam and H2-fired calciner

South America is an important alumina producer with a 
relatively decarbonized grid. It would be feasible to retrofit 
refineries with electric boilers supplied with low-carbon 
electricity and green-hydrogen calciners.

•  Best available technology: existing refinery using gas 

•  Green investment: retrofit with electric boilers and H2 

calcination

Retrofitting a refinery in South America with electric 
boilers and H2 calciner, replacing current natural-gas-based 
technologies, would have a negative NPV of about $2.8 
billion. Setting up a carbon price (approximately $60 per 
tCO2e) and a CCfD for ten years (worth $330 million per 
year) could improve the investment NPV and offset prices for 
green hydrogen and green electricity (Exhibit 8). The electric 
boiler carries a larger negative NPV than MVR, which is more 
efficient from a thermal-energy perspective.

Policy levers such as carbon contracts for difference may likely be 
required for green reﬁnery investment to be economical.

roles for  
stakeholders

Whichever route is taken to decarbonization, it will require 
an effort from all players in the aluminum value chain. That 
said, individual approaches will vary—businesses will adopt 
decarbonization technologies that reflect local conditions, 
policy measures, and financial arrangements. For smelters 
relying on carbon-intensive electricity sources, for example, 
a carbon-pricing scheme that includes power emissions 
would better enable green investment. Where the operating 
expenditure gap to BAT is more relevant than the capital 
expenditure gap, demand and policy levers would play a more 
important role.

3.1  End users

The analysis shows that end users would need to pay a green 
premium to offset a negative NPV in all five scenarios. It 
assumes a 5 percent premium on the LME commodity price 
($100/t aluminum) in smelter cases and a 10 percent premium 
($34/t) on alumina for the refinery cases. These would both 
improve the NPV of the green-investment option.

Many aluminum consumers have decarbonization goals for their 
supply chains, so paying a premium could still be attractive. 

PAGE 20

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SenseIndeed, increased demand for green products would help shift 
the aluminum industry further toward decarbonization. Still, 
some end users are unlikely to see a substantial increase 
in final product prices after incorporating green-aluminum 
premiums into production costs. For example, at a green 
premium of $100/t aluminum, the final cost of a new car would 
increase by just 0.01 percent.22 Even if the green premium 
covered the total additional cost of fully decarbonized 
aluminum production (estimated to be about $400/t in 
203523) and the aluminum in cars rose to 200 kilograms (kg) 
as projected, the final cost would increase by just 0.2 percent.

Furthermore, many aluminum consumers have 
decarbonization goals for their sourcing and supply chains, 
so purchasing a green aluminum product with a premium 
could likely be acceptable to consumers. In short, rising end 
user demand for green products will help shift the aluminum 
industry toward decarbonization.

3.2  Governments 

The analysis shows that the greatest NPV impact comes from 
from carbon-pricing measures. This could shift the NPV balance 
in favor of decarbonized investment because emissions are 
covered by a carbon price. On that basis, the traditional smelter 
is substantially more expensive. In all scenarios, the analysis 
considers the impact of a starting carbon price of $60/tCO2e, 
growing 0.5 percent per year.

There is, however, an additional gap that needs to be covered. 
Grants and CCfDs could offset the capital and operating costs 
associated with decarbonized investment, even though the 
impact would be relatively low compared with that of carbon 
price mechanisms.

3.3  Financial institutions

Financial institutions also have the capability to shift cash 
flows and allocate significant funds to green investments. 
Due to generally high levels of debt as a share of total capital 
for investments in the aluminum industry (typically 50 to 75 
percent), the bond and loan markets would be key enablers. 
Financial institutions could use green loans, green bonds, 
transition bonds, and sustainability-linked loans and bonds to 
meet their decarbonization targets. If these instruments offered 
players a lower interest rate or a longer tenure compared with 
financial products directed at carbon-intensive activities, they 
would further support decarbonization.

Rising demand for low-carbon products is pushing the 
aluminium industry away from the carbon-emitting processes 
that have dominated production for the past 136 years. These 
positive steps are predicated on a more significant role for 
frontier technologies that could reduce or completely abate the 
GHG emissions in refineries and smelters. 

However, the analysis in this paper shows that financial insti-
tutions, end users, and government will need to work together 
to turn frontier technologies into net-positive projects that 
players can scale. No player in the value chain can decarbonize 
the sector alone. Indeed, end users could pay a green premium 
to cover the decarbonization cost, likely including a higher 
premium to encourage the large-scale investment required to 
reach committed emission targets. In addition, governments 
and financial institutions will play a key role covering the 
remaining decarbonization cost and accelerating investment 
decisions to quickly deploy frontier technologies.

PAGE 21

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SenseAppendix

Aluminum smelting direct-process and 
raw-material emissions

The average global direct emissions from aluminum smelting, 
including carbon anode manufacturing, is 2.5 tCO2e per metric 
ton of aluminum.24 

The majority of emissions—1.5 tCO2e/t of aluminum25—are 
process CO2 emissions generated during carbon anode 
production. This is part of electrolytic reduction where 
aluminum is deposited in liquid form on the cathode and 
oxygen is deposited on the anode. Oxygen reacts with the 
anode to form CO2 gas while the aluminum is tapped in 
batches from the cell.26

In addition to CO2 emissions, the electrolysis process generates 
perfluorocarbon compounds (PFCs) in what is known as the 
anode effect. The anode effect occurs when the alumina 
dissolved in the cryolite melt falls to a concentration level 
too low to support the current flow at the nominal voltage for 
aluminum production. During these periods, which typically 
occur during 0.03–0.50 percent of the total electrolysis time, 

the voltage rises to a level where reactions are initiated that 
produce the PFCs.27 The average global emissions of PFCs are 
0.5 tCO2e/t of aluminum and can be reduced to 0.02 tCO2e/t of 
aluminum by implementing best practices.28

The remaining 0.5 tCO2e/t of aluminum are associated with 
carbon anode manufacturing (Exhibit 9). This process requires 
the use of two main raw materials: calcined petroleum coke 
(CPC) and coal tar pitch (CTP). In the process, leftovers from 
dismantled anodes, called anode butts, are also recycled to 
reduce the use of raw material.

CPC is produced by processing raw “green” petroleum coke—a 
by-product of petroleum refining—into rotary kilns, where 
it is heated to temperatures between 1,200˚C and 1,350˚C. 
These high temperatures remove excess moisture, extract all 
remaining volatile hydrocarbons, and modify the crystalline 
structure of the coke, resulting in a denser, more electrically 
conductive product. CPC can be generated on-site or sourced 
from third-party companies. This process typically generates 
0.3 tCO2e/t of aluminum emissions.

Carbon capture and storage is applicable in different steps of the 
aluminum value chain.

PAGE 22

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes SenseThe CPC is then processed to achieve a specific particle size 
distribution using a crushing and grinding circuit with particle 
classifiers. Once the required particle size distribution is 
reached, the processed petroleum coke is combined with 
CTP, a thick dark liquid, which is a distilled by-product of the 
production of coke and coal gas from coke ovens.

This mixture is molded to the required anode shape 
(denominated green anode) and then is thermally treated using 
an anode baking furnace. In this furnace, the green anodes are 
stacked between refractory walls separated by a flue channel 
in which hot gases flow. The overall baking cycle could last 
10 to 14 days. For each metric ton of aluminum, about 0.4 t of 
anode is expected to be consumed. Because of the presence of 
volatile hydrocarbons, this process generates 0.1 t of CO2e/t of 
aluminum from anode baking furnace direct thermal energy and 
0.1 t of CO2e/t aluminum from volatile-matter combustion.

The largest technical challenge to improving the energy 
efficiency of electrolysis is the development of a non-
consumable inert anode.

Aluminum smelting direct-emission 
decarbonization levers

Most of the technical challenges associated with direct 
smelting emissions relate to CO2 generation due to anode 
fabrication and anode consumption in the electrolysis process. 
For decades, the aluminum industry has been investigating 
the implementation of a non-consumable anode that 
could potentially abate most of the CO2 generation during 
electrolysis and generate oxygen instead (inert anode). 
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is also being explored as a 
way to retrofit existing operating smelters’ facilities.

requires use of an alternative, non-consumable material such as 
metal (for example, iron-nickel base alloy) or ceramic (including 
cermet) to replace the carbon anodes. Implementing this 
technology could increase the life span of the anodes by two to 
three years and generate oxygen as a by-product. 

Wetted cathode is an alternative solution to improve system 
efficiency. This technology uses titanium diboride (TiB2) to wet 
the cathode surface. By creating a cathode surface that is inert 
and wettable on the molten aluminum pad, the anode-cathode 
distance can be reduced by 50 percent or more, reducing the 
voltage drop and leading to substantial energy savings.

Inert-anode technology, coupled with wetted cathodes, offers 
the greatest opportunity to reduce GHG emissions with high 
efficiency. It eliminates the CO2 and PFCs (particularly carbon 
tetrafluoride) associated with the consumption of the carbon 
anodes, as well as the need to manufacture a carbon anode 
in the first place.29 However, direct-process and raw-material 
emissions from inert anodes could be 0.25 t of CO2/t of 
aluminum, mostly linked to the production of ceramic-base 
inert anodes.30 The electricity intensity of inert anodes is still 
uncertain, but could be as much as 20 percent more than in the 
Hall-Héroult process.31

There is currently no industrial-scale inert anode–based 
technology for aluminum smelting, though multiple companies 
are exploring the idea, and a commercial-scale plant is expected 
to be developed by 2030. ELYSIS (a joint venture among Alcoa, 
Apple, Rio Tinto, and the Canadian government) is running 
industrial trials at the Alma smelter in Canada. Apart from these 
two examples, there is very little public information on inert-
anode operational performance, and estimates on when this will 
be adopted on an industrial scale vary vastly. 

There are only three alternatives for aluminum smelters to 
decarbonize their direct smelting emissions, none of which is 
proven today (Exhibit 10):

Inert anode: The potential aluminum game 
changer

Inert-anode technology has been seen as the main alternative 
to carbon anodes in the Hall-Héroult process. This technology 

Deployment of CCS in the industry and transformation sector 
(cement, chemicals, fuel, and steel) shows promise for this 
approach to CO2 abatement. These sectors accounted for 30 
commercial CCS facilities in operation in 2021, with many more 
planned, including in the steel industry.32

Implementation in the aluminum industry is possible but 
presents challenges relating to low CO2 concentration in the 
off-gas stream (Exhibit 11). This low concentration, specifically 
on the smelter process, is associated with the entrainment 
of fresh air required to manage the process heat balance. 
As a consequence, overall CO2 concentration is reduced to 
about 1 volume percent. One alternative is to redesign the

aluminum-smelter pots to avoid air leakage and increase the 
CO2 concentration by 4–10 volume percent so the CCS process 
becomes economically viable.33 

The anode production value chain could also benefit from 
implementing CCS. Although this portion of the value chain 
still has low CO2 concentration (less than 10 volume percent), 
evolution in CCS technology applied to the cement industry 
could likely be retrofitted to the petcoke calcination process 
(similar usage of rotary kiln). The process of CO2 concentration 
could also be boosted by oxyfuel firing and retrofitting existing 
operations with heat recovery units (such as boilers). This would 
avoid the use of bleed air to reduce gas temperature.34

The last portion of the anode value chain that could benefit 
from CCS implementation is the anode baking furnace. This 
technology could reduce CO2 emissions from both direct energy 
input and volatile-matter combustion. Alternatively, considering 
that about 50 percent of energy for anode baking is related to 
direct energy input (mostly from natural gas or oil firing), the 
process could be reengineered to implement electric heating 
(with access to renewable energy) and to combine direct or air 
capture to reduce the remaining 0.1 t of CO2e/t aluminum.

Among all CCS use cases, aluminum smelting, petcoke 
calcination, and anode baking furnace have a relatively low 
CO2 concentration compared with natural-gas processing,

cement rotary kilns, or coal-fired power plants. However, CCS 
is likely to be viable on smaller emissions sources only if sites 
can combine carbon capture on-site with smelter process CCS. 
Since many smelters do not have on-site anode production, 
this is a key barrier. Therefore, for first-of-a-kind projects, the 
CO2e avoided capture rate would likely be below 90 percent. 
Assuming a 70 percent efficiency factor, the implementation 
of CCS in the smelter and raw-material process could reduce 
the CO2e emissions from 2.0 t of CO2e /t aluminum to 0.7 t of 
CO2e/t aluminum (Exhibit 12).

Carbochlorination with CO2 
regeneration

Carbochlorination with CO2 regeneration is an alternative to 
the current aluminum smelting process.35 Alcoa developed 
this process as a proposed alternative to the Hall-Héroult 
process. One of the initial benefits was a significant reduction 

in specific energy consumption (about eight MWh/t of Al), 
and the electrolysis could be carried out in a lower electrolyte 
temperature (about 720°C). 

As proposed by Alcoa, the process includes the chlorination 
of aluminum oxide (alumina) obtained in the Bayer process, 
using CO as a reducing agent and chlorine gas (Cl2) as a 
chlorination agent. The resulting aluminum chloride (AlCl3) is 
then electrolyzed using a bipolar cell. The advantage of this 
process over the conventional Hall-Héroult process is that 
the aluminum chloride electrolysis produces a pure stream 
of Cl2 that can be recycled back into the chlorination process, 
while the chlorination process produces a pure stream of CO2 
that could potentially be combined with CCS. The industry is 
also exploring the alternative of CO regeneration, which could 
reduce the use of CO (mostly generated by conventional sub-
stoichiometry combustion). This would be through a closed-
loop circuit that would electrolyze the generated CO2 and

could potentially add about 5 percent of the initial capital cost of 
the project. 

Although this process has been studied for a long time, project 
development is stalled because of difficulties associated 
with production and handling of pure aluminum trichloride. 
Aluminum players are still considering the benefits, with 
potential deployment of pilot operations by 2030 and an 
industrial-scale plant in the midterm. 

Decarbonization capital expenditures

Capital expenditures for the Hall-Héroult process range from 
$2,100/t Al capacity (mostly in China) to $6,000/t Al capacity 
(mostly in Canada and Norway).36 Approximately 50 percent 
of this cost is associated with the area where the pots are 
installed, pot technology, and the anode production facility 
(Exhibit 13).

Retrofitting existing Hall-Héroult smelters with CCS technology, 
taking into account a CO2 concentration of 1 volume percent, 

The implementation of inert-anode technology could come 
at a similar capital cost to conventional smelter technology. 
Compared with Hall-Héroult technology, inert-anode projects 
have higher potroom costs, mostly associated with technology 
differences. Inert anodes would be produced in a centralized 
facility owned by the technology provider. Therefore, facilities 
will not require on-site anode production, and smelters will need 
to purchase the inert anodes to replace anodes that are near 
the end of life (two to three years). Given that the technology 
provider will own the technology and the intellectual property, 
capital expenditures will not vary significantly across regions. 

Decarbonization operating 
expenditures

In 2021, the average operating cost of aluminum smelters 
worldwide was calculated to be between $1,654 and $1,750 per 
metric ton of aluminum,37 with more than 88 percent of the cost 

PAGE 26

Aluminum Decarbonization at a Cost That Makes Senseassociated with raw materials (44 percent), electricity38 (30 
percent), and anode production and consumption (14 percent) 
(Exhibit 14).

The implementation of CCS in existing smelter facilities could 
potentially lift overall operating costs by 6 percent, with most 
of the share (about 5.6 percent) associated with CCS operating 
costs and the balance with CCS energy consumption over Hall-
Héroult cost.

Inert-anode technology, on the other hand, shows an operating 
cost reduction of 3–10 percent. Although energy consumption 
could be 20 percent higher than with Hall-Héroult, the longer 
life of the anode or cathode has a cost benefit. This wide range 
is associated with the implementation of the technology and 
the respective technology learning curve, with the first years of 
operation having the lowest cost benefit compared with existing 
smelting technology. This would rapidly increase during the first 
years of operation while the industry implements commercial 
improvements and best practices. This learning curve is 
expected to be rapid (one to two years) because of extensive 
pilot testing in the past decade. In order to be cheaper than 
existing Hall-Héroult technology, inert anodes will likely need 
to have a life span or two years or more, and cathodes will likely 
need to work for four years or more.

Refining: The Bayer process

The Bayer process can be separated into two main carbon 
intensive processes: digestion and calcination.

Digestion operating expenditures and capital 
expenditures

Decarbonization levels in refinery digestion plays an important 
role but requires extra investment for retrofitting of existing 

facilities. In this comparison, a natural-gas boiler was utilized 
as the baseline “best available technology.” The natural-gas 
boiler assumes overall capital expenditures of $50 per metric 
ton of alumina (Aa) and operating expenditure cost of $63/t Aa, 
mostly associated with fuel costs (Exhibit 15). 

An electric boiler could incur an additional capital-project cost 
of 10 percent, while operating costs associated with electricity 
sourcing could rise by 35 percent (assuming an electricity price 
of $37/MWh). Hydrogen-fired boiler prices could incur a similar 
capital expenditure as natural-gas boilers, but operating costs 
would be highly dependent on hydrogen prices and increase 
fuel cost about 4.3 times over existing natural-gas operations.39 

Implementation of MVR technology shows the most reduction 
in operating costs—approximately 40 percent. This is mostly 
associated with heat loss recovery from the process. Despite 
the reduction in operating costs, the technology incurs higher 
capital expenditures with an increment of about 50 percent 
compared with natural-gas boilers. 

Calcination operating expenditure and capital 
expenditure

The implementation of a green-hydrogen-based calciner 
could have the best decarbonization potential for calcination 
under a gas suspension technology baseline, considering that 
existing installed technologies could be quickly retrofitted for 
hydrogen firing. 

Carbon capture could be an alternative solution when sourcing 
green hydrogen is difficult (for example, due to a remote 
location with no access to renewable energy). This technology 
could require an additional $42/t Aa of capital investment and 
would increase operating expenditures by $50/t Aa (Exhibit 16).
