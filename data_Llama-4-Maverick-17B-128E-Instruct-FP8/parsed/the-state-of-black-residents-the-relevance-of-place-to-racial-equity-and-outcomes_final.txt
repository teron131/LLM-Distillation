Executive summary

Our 2021 report The economic state of Black America used a unique lens, exploring the barriers 
and opportunities that Black Americans encounter in the various roles they play in the economy: 
as workers, business owners, savers and investors, consumers, and residents (in the context of 
community environments and public programs). Since then, we have followed up with a more detailed 
analysis of Black consumers.1 Here we similarly zoom in to analyze the Black resident experience.2  

People shape places, and places in turn shape outcomes for people. Racial disparities reported 
at the national level in the United States are broad averages that obscure what is happening in 
specific communities, whether they are stories of progress, stagnation, or regression. 

To take on this multifaceted concept, we begin by defining a set of quality-of-life aspirations 
and looking at metrics related to them at the county level. We then aggregate the results for 
places with similar characteristics, including various types of American cities, suburbs, and rural 
counties. This approach enables us to examine which environments offer Black residents the 
best quality of life and which have gotten closer to the goal of creating more equitable outcomes.

The results show substantial differences in overall outcomes for Black residents across 
community profiles—as well as substantial gaps between Black and White residents in virtually 
every county. We find that America’s suburbs and exurbs currently seem to have the nation’s best 
balance of positive overall Black outcomes and parity. But even here, large disparities persist. 
Effectively, there is nowhere in the United States where outcomes for Black residents equal 
those of their White neighbors. Moreover, most places close to parity are small rural counties 
where outcomes are poor for all residents, regardless of race. 

We also look across the past decade to gauge the rate of progress. While multiple metrics have 
been improving for Black residents, those gains have not closed racial gaps in any meaningful 
way, as White outcomes improved to the same degree or even more so. At the current pace, it 
could take more than three centuries for Black residents across the nation to reach parity with 
their White neighbors. Progress has not yielded parity.

Mapping the gaps can help investors, companies, philanthropies, and public-sector leaders decide 
where and how to act. What works in a dynamic city with high inequality may not be right for a rural 
county with a stagnant economy. Our hope is that looking at people and places holistically will yield 
solutions that are transformative for Black residents and the trajectory of their communities. 

We look at varied types of communities across the United States to  
assess the experiences of their Black residents
The United States has more than 3,000 counties. Some are thriving, some are distressed, and many 
more are somewhere in between. Mirroring previous McKinsey Global Institute research, we sort 
counties into distinct community profiles based on economic metrics, size, and other characteristics 
(Exhibit E1). We use this categorization to examine geographic variation in the economic, social,  
and physical well-being of residents in general and of Black residents in particular.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesWhile our data covers a wider range of community profiles, we focus on the subset in which some 
90 percent of Black Americans live. They fall into the following categories (Exhibit E2):

 — Urban core. Twelve megacities, the nation’s largest urban centers, are home to 23 percent 
of the US population but 30 percent of all Black Americans. In addition, 13 high-growth 
hubs (places such as Austin, Charlotte, Minneapolis, and Silicon Valley) are home to almost 
7 percent of the US population and a roughly equivalent share of the Black population. Both 
types of cities have high-growth industries, higher incomes, stronger job markets, and 
younger and more educated workforces than the rest of the country. Yet they have greater 
inequality and high costs of living. 

 — Suburbs and exurbs. We refer to the 271 counties that make up the extended suburbs 
of US cities as the urban periphery. They have the highest median household income 
of all community profiles. Home to about 17 percent of the US population but just under 
12 percent of all Black Americans, they have attracted people moving out of dense urban 
settings in search of more space. A significant share of the population commutes into nearby 
urban areas. 

 — Mixed middle. This category includes 36 stable cities (such as Cincinnati, Jacksonville, and 
St. Louis) and 94 smaller independent economies (such as Lancaster, PA, and Winston-
Salem, NC). These places have slower economic and job growth, higher unemployment, and 
moderately educated workforces. Stable cities are home to 12 percent of the US population 
but 19 percent of all Black Americans.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes — Low-growth and rural areas. More than 2,000 rural counties are home to just over 18 percent 

of the US population and 15 percent of all Black Americans. Rural counties encompass 
somewhat better-performing places (stable rural counties) and struggling areas defined 
by slower economic growth (trailing rural counties). In both, populations are older, 
unemployment is higher, and educational attainment is lower than the national average. 

In each of these environments, we ground our analysis in a set of aspirations for all residents, 
regardless of race. These include a basic standard of living; financial stability; job opportunities 
with decent pay and good working conditions; long and healthy lives; opportunities to develop 
skills through affordable, quality education; stable and secure homes; physical and virtual 
connectivity; and stable communities. These are about more than surviving; they define what it 
takes for an individual or a family to thrive. 

For each aspiration, we focus on between two and four priority metrics that convey how residents 
are faring. For example, to measure the aspiration for “long and healthy lives,” we assess life 
expectancy, health insurance coverage, and survey responses indicating overall physical and 
mental health for both Black and White residents of each US county. In all, we use 25 metrics 
to calculate “Black outcome scores,” then use those scores to compare and rank community 
profiles.3 Higher scores generally indicate greater prosperity and well-being relative to Black 
residents of other places.

Black outcomes are generally better in suburban and high-growth areas  
where Black residents are underrepresented
Overall, no community profile and no individual county stands out for having the highest Black 
outcome scores across the full range of metrics. But some rank at or near the top on multiple 
quality-of-life aspirations. 

In broad terms, outcomes for Black residents are better in places with stronger economic 
foundations. However, these types of places have smaller Black populations (Exhibit E3). 

The nation’s suburbs and exurbs have the highest overall Black outcome scores. They come out 
on top or as runner-up across seven of our eight aspirations, leading in metrics such as median 
household income ($79,000), workers in management roles (36 percent), life expectancy 
(78 years), and bachelor’s degree attainment (29 percent). But less than 12 percent of Black 
Americans live in the urban periphery, five percentage points lower than the share of the total US 
population in this community profile. 

The second-highest overall Black outcome scores are in high-growth hubs (places such as 
Las Vegas and Seattle). Yet just over 6 percent of Black Americans live in these economically 
dynamic communities. Underrepresentation is notable in places such as San Jose/Silicon Valley, 
CA, and Austin, TX, where high-wage tech jobs are concentrated. While these places produce 
relatively high overall Black outcomes, their cost of living lowers their rankings for financial 
stability and housing.   

Black Americans are overrepresented in two urban community profiles. More than 30 percent 
live in megacities (such as Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, 
and Washington, DC). These urban areas have strong economies and above-average Black 
household incomes ($68,000); their Black residents match those in the urban periphery 

3  The metrics for standard of living are poverty rates, child poverty rates, and share of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 

Program recipients. For financial stability, we look at median household income and the ratio of income to cost of living. For 
job opportunities, we consider the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, and the shares of workers in both 
management roles and service occupations. In skill development, we consider the shares of the population with bachelor’s 
degrees and above, with some college but no degree, and without high school diplomas. The metrics for stable and secure 
homes are the share of the population that is rent burdened (spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing), 
overcrowding rates (with more than one occupant per room), and homeownership rates. For connectivity, we consider the 
share of the population with commutes exceeding 45 minutes, the share of the population without broadband, and the share of 
households lacking cars. For stable community, we consider the incarceration rate and vacancy rates.

in college degree attainment and workers in management roles. But megacities also have 
high costs of living, reflected in the highest shares of Black residents with long commutes 
(29 percent) and outsize rent burdens (51 percent). Almost 19 percent of Black Americans live in 
less dynamic stable cities, where median incomes tend to be lower, at $52,000 (although lower 
costs of living make incomes go further). Stable cities rank poorly on health and longevity, and 
near last among all community profiles for Black residents’ mental and physical health and on 
measures of stable community.

Locations that fit the two rural community profiles are home to about 15 percent of all Black 
Americans—and rank near last on most Black outcome scores. Poverty and food insecurity rates 
among rural Black residents range from 28 to 32 percent; lower life expectancies (74 to 75 years) 
may reflect high uninsured rates (12 percent). However, rural communities do rank highly in 
housing (driven by lower rent burden, higher homeownership rates, and less overcrowding). 
Notably, Black Americans are overrepresented in trailing rural counties and underrepresented in 
stable rural counties.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesVirtually nowhere in the nation are outcomes for Black residents on a  
par with those of their White neighbors 
First, no US county with a sizable Black population has achieved parity—or even come close. 
Only 37 with more than 25 Black residents are close to parity, and collectively, these counties are 
home to just 39,000 Black residents, or 0.1 percent of the Black US population (Exhibit E4).4 We 
draw these insights by comparing Black resident outcomes to those of White residents of the 
same communities. 

Racial gaps in outcomes are largest in megacities and stable cities, which are collectively home 
to about half of all Black Americans (Exhibit E5). Black residents of megacities outearn their 
peers at a national level but earn roughly 60 percent of what White megacity residents do. The 
gaps in Black and White commute times are notable, showing that many Black residents have 
difficulty affording homes in convenient megacity neighborhoods.

Stable cities tend to have substantial racial gaps in incomes, the job market, and opportunities 
for education and skills development. They also have a notable Black–White gap in rent burden; 
Black renters are 20 percent more likely than White renters to spend at least 30 percent of their 
incomes on housing. Black residents in stable cities are also more than twice as likely as White 
residents to lack cars and broadband. 

In addition, high-growth hubs, which post relatively good Black outcome scores, do poorly on 
parity, with sizable racial gaps on long and healthy lives, education for developing skills, and 
stable and secure homes. 

Inequality in all three of these urban community profiles could be partly attributed to outmigration 
that has hollowed out the middle class over time.5 Also, major cities have historically enacted 

5  See, for example, “America’s shrinking middle class: A close look at changes within metropolitan areas,” Pew Research Center, 
May 2016; and August Benzow, “Exodus from urban counties hit a record in 2021,” Economic Innovation Group, March 2022.

disadvantages for many Black residents. 

As noted above, the urban periphery has the highest overall Black outcomes. Yet even there, 
Black outcome scores are just 64 percent of White outcome scores. The racial gaps are 
especially large in housing. Only 52 percent of Black suburbanites own their homes, compared 
with 78 percent of their White peers. 

Overall, rural areas (and particularly distressed rural areas) come closer to parity—but this 
reflects poor outcomes across the board for their entire populations. In cases like these, as well 
as in many urban settings, higher Black outcomes and parity can appear to present a trade-off 
(Exhibit E6).

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesOutcomes for Black residents generally improved over the past decade,  
but unevenly and with some exceptions
Are things at least trending in the right direction? Black residents did see progress, though not 
always swift, in most types of American communities from 2012 to 2021. Overall Black outcome 
scores improved in 73 percent of US counties that are collectively home to some 34 million Black 
residents. Stable cities, trailing rural counties, and high-growth hubs experienced the largest 
gains, with overall Black outcome scores rising 6.5 percent on average. 

Looking more closely at what drove this progress reveals differences across community 
profiles. For example, stable cities saw lower Black unemployment rates, a shift away from 
Black representation in service roles and toward management roles, lower Black rent burdens, 
and improved vacancy and incarceration rates. Trailing rural counties showed progress 
across many categories, including a notable jump in broadband access for Black residents. 
Both high-growth hubs and megacities had higher bachelor’s degree attainment and lower 
shares of Black residents who attended college but did not obtain degrees (although this may 
reflect the industries in the urban core and the profiles of Black workers who tend to move to 
those locations). 

Community profiles also experienced some common challenges over the past decade. All saw 
declining Black homeownership and increasing commute times. Other common challenges likely 
resulted from the pandemic, such as reduced labor force participation rates, lower preschool 
enrollment rates, and declines in self-reported mental health. 

Results are mixed when it comes to narrowing racial gaps over time
While Black outcomes improved over the decade in most of the counties in each segment, only 
about half of those counties narrowed the gaps between the overall scores of Black and White 
residents. In most community profiles, the racial gaps in some metrics barely budged.

The quality of life is improving on multiple dimensions for everyone, but progress is taking 
significantly longer to filter through to Black residents. Their gains have not been rapid or 
dramatic enough to make up for disadvantaged starting points. In short, progress does not 
automatically equal parity, or even put Black Americans on a trajectory toward parity.

Trailing rural counties started and finished the decade with the highest level of parity among 
the seven community profiles (but, as noted above, the poorest overall outcomes for all 
residents). Over this time period, the gaps narrowed most in megacities and the urban periphery 
(Exhibit E7). These results may, of course, reflect long-term trends in who moves in and out.

In four of the aspirational categories, there was at least some progress toward parity across all 
seven community profiles: 

 — Standard of living: Rates of poverty and food insecurity for Black residents ended the 

decade lower in relation to the rates for White residents.

 — Stable homes: While there was a growing racial gap in homeownership across all seven 
community profiles, this was offset by narrowed gaps in rent burdens and overcrowding. 

 — Connectivity: There was mixed progress in racial disparities in commute time, although  
racial gaps shrank across the board in households without car access and without a 
broadband subscription. 

 — Stable communities: Most places saw narrowed racial gaps in incarceration and 

vacancy rates. 

The other four aspirations generally saw either limited progress or widening disparities over the 
past decade:

 — Financial stability: Racial disparities in household income widened across rural America and 

in stable cities and high-growth hubs; elsewhere, there was scarcely any movement.

slightly in most community profiles, but gaps in the shares of Black and White workers in 
management roles widened. There was little overall change in this category as a result.

 — Long and healthy lives: Gaps in the uninsured share of the Black and White populations 

widened in cities, narrowed in rural areas, and remained little changed in the urban periphery.

 — Skill development: Racial gaps in bachelor’s degree attainment improved slightly in all 

community profiles, but disparities in residents who started college but did not graduate 
worsened. Moreover, gaps between the Black and White populations without high school 
diplomas barely changed.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesAt current rates of change, how long would it take to improve outcomes  
and achieve racial parity? 
First, we consider how long it would take to lift all other Black residents to the levels of prosperity 
and well-being enjoyed by those in the urban periphery (currently the top-performing community 
profile). At the current pace of change, it could take anywhere from 10 to 30 years for all other 
areas of the nation to match the suburbs and exurbs in overall outcomes for Black residents. 
Cities would catch up sooner. 

Second, we estimate how long it would take for Black Americans to reach parity with their White 
neighbors. Based on the rate of change between 2012 and 2021, it could take more than three 
centuries for all community profiles to reach parity (Exhibit E8). For simplicity, this analysis assumes 
that outcomes for White residents remain at today’s levels. But based on history, these will likely 
continue to improve—which means that our estimate, while sobering, is actually conservative. 

In short, recent improvements have taken a small chisel to a large mountain of past inequities 
that have accrued over time. Without faster change, the United States would not achieve racial 
parity in our lifetimes, or even in our children’s or grandchildren’s lifetimes.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesSolutions need different forms in different communities, but getting  
to parity requires more speed and scale than ever before 
Glacial progress in leveling the playing field denies Black residents both economic and social 
opportunities. Since the resident experience has cascading effects on their roles as workers, 
consumers, savers, and business owners, the United States is shortchanging the broader 
economy by not addressing issues that hinder millions of people from reaching their full potential. 
To prevent these disparities from lingering for future generations, all stakeholders will need to 
bring fresh energy and urgency to engaging on solutions.

But where to start? One option is to take a place-based approach, investing in a range of 
initiatives within specific communities. The Harlem Children’s Zone is a notable example of this 
approach, offering comprehensive “cradle-to-career” programming for low-income children 
and families with an emphasis on educational achievement. Other examples include the East 
Baltimore Development Initiative, Atlanta’s East Lake Foundation, and San Diego’s City Heights 
Initiative.6 National nonprofits, philanthropic investors, and government entities can support 
these types of local efforts. 

Another option is taking a thematic approach to solutions, focusing on key levers that could 
improve outcomes across many communities. It is beyond the scope of this research to offer 
solutions for the full range of issues raised. But we do look at two priority areas for action: 
affordable housing and the birth-to-kindergarten care infrastructure. We single them out 
because meeting these needs could have positive ripple effects on other aspects of well-being. 
They are critical for getting many low- and middle-income residents of all races to a base 
level of thriving today, with lasting benefits for Black residents that could eventually improve 
racial parity as well. These issues illustrate how challenges and solutions can differ across 
community profiles. 

Affordable housing: Density defines the nature of the challenge
Across the United States, about half of all renter households spend more than 30 percent of 
their income on housing; a quarter spend more than 50 percent.7 By contrast, only 22 percent of 
homeowners are either moderately or severely cost burdened. Together, these dynamics make 
housing unaffordability particularly acute for Black residents, who are both less likely to own 
homes and more likely to be cost burdened. 

Recent research estimates that 7.3 million additional affordable homes are needed across 
the United States, particularly to meet the needs of extremely low-income renters.8 Based on 
average costs reported by states and cities and the distribution of need across community 
profiles, we estimate that building costs could run up to $2.4 trillion.9 While that is an enormous 
sum, it would yield real returns—and the projects themselves generate jobs and economic 
activity. Tackling this shortage, particularly by adding affordable units in low-poverty 
neighborhoods and mixed-income developments, could help improve educational outcomes  
and economic mobility for the next generation. 

However, large-scale building needs to be implemented carefully so that revitalization does not 
lead to displacement. Projects would need community input and fair processes for allocating 
new units, balancing the needs of new arrivals and current residents.

based-initiatives.

9  Average cost ranges from $178,000 to $600,000, based on reported average building costs for 15 states and cities. We use 

poverty rates across community profiles as a proxy for the likely distribution of need.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesIn megacities, high-growth hubs, and stable cities, where approximately half of Black households 
are rent burdened, one of the most important strategies is unlocking land. This could involve 
allowing taller projects around transit, reducing minimum lot sizes, and building infill housing 
on vacant parcels. Cities can also streamline approval processes and allow bigger projects if a 
certain percentage of units is reserved for low-income renters. 

Private- and social-sector actors have a large role to play as well. In the post-pandemic world, 
developers can work with cities to convert commercial properties into housing. Adopting 
prefab construction at scale could reduce the development costs of multifamily housing by 
5 to 15 percent.10 Nonprofits can also develop new housing or acquire and renovate residential 
communities to preserve existing affordable housing.

While the scarcity of land drives the housing crunch in dense cities, rural areas have the 
opposite problem. They have land, but their more fragmented nature and smaller populations 
make it harder to attract capital. These regions can focus on rehabbing existing homes. The US 
Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development Program, for example, offers low-cost loans 
and grants to low-income homeowners, often partnering with Habitat for Humanity chapters 
to execute repairs. Repurposing abandoned structures such as storefronts and warehouses 
can inject new life into neglected main streets—but just as in cities, some kind of public or 
philanthropic element may be needed to build affordability into revitalization projects. 

Early childhood education builds a foundation for better academic and  
professional outcomes
High-quality early childhood development programs can change the trajectory of disadvantaged 
children’s lives. Formal childcare and pre-K also can be critical to parents’ ability to work and 
provide for their families. Among families who pay for childcare, the cost eats up 23 percent of 
Black families’ income on average, compared with 15 percent for White families.11 This can leave 
many Black parents with the dilemma of either spending an unsustainable amount on childcare 
or exiting the workforce.

While 53 percent of children aged three to four were enrolled in preschool as of 2022, this means 
almost half of this age group—or 3.5 million children—are not enrolled.12 Moreover, most three- 
and four-year-old preschool students are in privately funded programs. If we aspire to the goal 
of giving all three- and four-year-olds access to high-quality public preschool, the estimated 
number of additional student places needed increases to a total of about 6.1 million.13  

Making publicly funded preschool universal in our seven community profiles implies the need for 
an additional 614,000 educators and paraprofessionals, at a cost of some $78 billion annually. 
This is based on a study estimating the cost of a high-quality, full-day pre-K program at $12,700 
per child, a figure that approaches national spending per child on K–12 education.14 The cost is 
linked to employing preschool teachers with specialized training and paying them living wages—
which would have a double benefit for Black economic mobility, since Black women make up 
about 17 percent of early childhood educators. The returns on this type of investment could 
be substantial. Some studies have estimated that high-quality early childhood education for 
disadvantaged children can deliver a return on investment of anywhere from 7 to 13 percent.15

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesCurrent spending is only about half that figure per child, a level that has barely budged in two 
decades. Even in the cities and states committed to pre-K for all, shortfalls mean that not 
every child who tries to enroll is able to do so. Children whose parents may lack resources or 
information about enrollment processes are least likely to gain access. 

Given the need to boost outcomes (and parity) for low-income children, it could seem logical to 
consider public programs for only those families with the greatest need. But universal programs, 
while more expensive, can deliver commensurately larger benefits. Exposure to diverse 
classmates has been shown to have a positive effect on development.16 Low-income families 
are more likely to enroll in universal programs than in targeted programs for which they qualify.17 
Further streamlining application processes and boosting parental awareness through outreach 
campaigns could accelerate progress toward parity. 

While many urban children still cannot access high-quality preschool, the nation’s cities do have 
advantages—such as the presence of colleges and universities, and larger school systems—on 
which to build. Density and transit mean that preschools are generally accessible (although 
density also makes it more expensive to build new capacity in these areas). The challenges differ 
in rural areas, where families are more likely to rely on informal home-based preschool rather 
than center-based programs.18 Nearly two-thirds of rural families live in so-called childcare 
deserts. Small populations may make it hard for private providers to stay afloat. 

Without greater and more sustained public funding, early childhood education will remain 
patchwork. While advocating for system-level change, employers and philanthropists can fill 
some of these gaps. A small but growing number of companies—including Marriott, Tyson 
Foods, and Patagonia—have begun offering their own on-site daycare and pre-K programs.19 
One recent report noted that while few philanthropists prioritize early childhood education, their 
willingness to give rises dramatically when they are presented with evidence of its impact. There 
are individuals and foundations with the resources to make a difference; presenting them with a 
fact base and clear funding opportunities could mobilize them.20 

While the path to better outcomes is long and the path to parity is even longer, we hope to speed 
these journeys, in part by illuminating where stakeholders can step in and step up. Both existing 
and innovative solutions are needed at mass scale, with a commitment to sustain them over 
time. They also need to resonate with the people they seek to serve, with Black leaders and 
communities helping to shape programs.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes1. The 
geography of 
Black America

Black Americans live in every kind of community that exists across the United States 
today.21 From cities to suburbs to rural areas, they share neighborhoods with residents of diverse 
backgrounds and aspire to the same goals all families do: health, safety, and prosperity for 
themselves and their loved ones. Black residents are more concentrated in some communities 
than in others, reflecting histories of enslavement, migration, and exclusion (see sidebar 
“Black migration, past and present”). Yet from these places have emanated vast contributions 
to American culture and society.22 Today, Black communities remain spaces of meaning, 
celebration, creativity, and connection for millions of Black Americans.23  

Unfortunately, Black communities today also face significant barriers. Racial gaps in many 
facets of the US economy—and in American society more broadly—remain stark and persistent. 
They have been documented in multiple research efforts, including our own.24 Our 2021 report 
estimated, for example, that if disparities in income and life expectancy did not exist, Black 
retirees would receive $31 billion more in Social Security benefits every year. It also found 
a $330 billion disparity between Black and White families in the annual flow of new wealth, 
$96 billion of which stems from pay gaps.25  

21  In this report, we use the terms “Black Americans” and “Black residents” interchangeably to refer to all individuals identified as 
Black or African American in data from the US Census Bureau, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the US 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (whose data the Vera Institute uses to calculate incarceration rates). The same is true for our use 
of the terms “White Americans” and “White residents.” We do not consider the immigration or citizenship status of any of the 
populations examined in this research.

issues 7–8, July 2016.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesDecade after decade, Black Americans have continued the work of overcoming and dismantling 
the barriers they face. Yet significant gaps remain, and progress has not yielded parity (Exhibit 1). 
A few cases in point: in 1990, almost one-third of Black families were below the federal poverty 
line. By 2021, that share had dropped below 20 percent. While that is commendable headway, 
it is still 11 percentage points higher than the rate for White families. The racial gap in life 
expectancy, once steadily narrowing, expanded again against the backdrop of the COVID-19 
pandemic.26 And while the share of Black Americans over age 25 with bachelor’s degrees shot up 
from 11.5 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2021, White Americans made even faster gains, going 
from 22 to nearly 38 percent.

Our 2021 report examined how Black Americans interact with the US economy as workers, 
business owners, savers and investors, consumers, and residents who are influenced by their 
community environments and served by public programs. In this research, we dig deeper into 
the resident role, this time with a more local lens. People shape places, and places in turn 
shape people. This report explores Black resident outcomes to better understand the state of 
racial equity across US communities—that is, the extent to which Black residents are able to 
participate in the economy and prosper to the same degree as their White peers.27 

Part of our analysis focuses on the general level of economic and social well-being in a given 
place. Some of these local outcomes are shaped by government at all levels, related to topics 
such as infrastructure, education, and economic development. In short, we want to examine

27  This definition of racial equity draws on PolicyLink’s “Equity Manifesto” (policylink.org/about-us/equity-manifesto). While the 
scope of this research is limited to comparing only Black and White resident outcomes, we acknowledge that the ultimate goal 
of racial equity is to build a society in which residents of all races are fully included and can realize their potential.

18

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomeshow different types of community environments across the nation are serving their residents 
overall—and especially their Black residents, who have a long history of being underserved if 
not outright excluded in multiple arenas. By painting a more detailed picture, we hope to start 
a conversation about how to lift whole communities. This may require a combination of federal, 
state, and tailored local and grassroots efforts, along with collaboration from private- and social-
sector stakeholders.

We consider the experiences of Black Americans in varied types  
of communities 
Most people would agree with the statement that where you are born shouldn’t determine your 
destiny. Yet that is often the case. Many Black communities were in fact formed by structural 
barriers, such as the restrictive zoning laws imposed in the early 20th century as many Black 
families were migrating to cities. Baltimore was the first city to adopt a racial zoning ordinance, 
in 1910; other cities followed, with lasting implications.28 One study found that cities that had 
implemented racially restrictive zoning before 1930 were significantly more likely to remain 
segregated by race and income as of 1970.29 Even after the Supreme Court outlawed racial 
ordinances, structural pressures on Black communities continued in many forms, including the 
razing of Black neighborhoods for federal highways, and the deed restrictions and redlining that 
limited homeownership and maintained segregated neighborhoods.30  

Research has given analytical backing to the notion that social mobility and inequality are 
closely connected to place. The communities in which people live can expand or constrain their 
opportunity, their education, their job prospects, and their ability to thrive.31 Geographic context 
shapes both economic outcomes and physical and mental well-being.32 Social connections 
and the health of the broader community also directly influence economic and social mobility. 
Scholars have found, for instance, that low-income children who grow up interacting with 
people of different economic classes are much more likely to become upwardly mobile.33 We 
refer to this broad phenomenon of place intersecting with social and economic outcomes as the 
“resident” experience. 

The value of a local view
Racial disparities reported at the national level are broad averages that tend to obscure the 
stories associated with specific places.34 For example, previous McKinsey research found that 
states with higher shares of Black residents were below the national averages for economic 
opportunity, employment, healthcare access, healthcare quality, public health, and access to

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesbroadband.35 Because geography is so intertwined with racial equity, this report takes a place-
based approach, going county by county and then aggregating results across places with similar 
characteristics. This enables us to examine which types of communities offer Black residents 
the best quality of life and which have managed to narrow the gaps between Black and White 
residents, getting closer to the goal of creating more equitable outcomes. 

We recognize the rich insights available via existing tools that take a place-based approach.36 
Our hope is to contribute an additional layer that can inform public, private, and social action to 
address inequities and better serve all residents.

While the community profiles used in this research offer a more nuanced view than blunt national 
figures, we acknowledge that they are not homogeneous. There is variation within them, shaped 
by local histories, cultures, and economic trends. And, within any given place, median Black 
outcomes do not capture variations or resident experiences shaped by elements of identity other 
than race. Accordingly, our findings are not a replacement for deeper, locally informed analysis 
of a given community. However, the view presented in this research does offer insight into what 
types of communities have produced better or worse as well as more or less equitable outcomes 
for Black residents. This could shed light on interventions that could be relevant in similar places. 

We examine 13 types of communities 
The United States has more than 3,000 counties. Collectively, they are a mosaic of local 
economies (Exhibit 2). Some are thriving, some are distressed, and many more are somewhere 
in between these two extremes. The patterns are much more nuanced than “city versus rural” or 
“coast versus heartland.” 

We look at a range of metrics on a county basis, then aggregate places with similar 
characteristics to highlight patterns, gaps, and spaces that need solutions. Ultimately, this view 
can give investors, companies, philanthropic funders, and public-sector leaders deeper context 
on where and how investment can improve socioeconomic outcomes.

Mirroring previous McKinsey Global Institute research, this report sorts individual communities 
into 13 distinct community profiles based on economic characteristics such as business 
dynamism, industry mix, labor force demographics, and more.37 However, this report uses 
these categories for different purposes. While MGI’s 2019 research used them to analyze 
the potential for future job growth and automation-related job losses, we use them here to 
examine the economic, social, and physical well-being of residents in general and of Black 
residents in particular. This will also provide perspective on how we think about potential 
solutions and investments to be made. 

While our research examines 13 types of communities, we primarily focus on seven that are home 
to some 90 percent of Black Americans. They generally fit into the following categories:38 

 — Urban core. Twelve megacities, the nation’s largest urban centers, are home to 23 percent 
of the US population but 30 percent of all Black Americans. In addition, 13 high-growth 
hubs (such as Austin, Charlotte, Minneapolis, and Silicon Valley) are some of the nation’s 
most economically dynamic places, with almost 7 percent of the US population and a roughly 
equivalent share of the Black population. Technology, media, healthcare, real estate, and 
finance make up a large share of both types of urban economies. These cities have higher

communities. We replicated this analysis more recently, using data through 2019, and reaffirmed that the categorization still 
holds. The community profiles we refer to as stable rural counties and trailing rural counties in this report correspond to the 
“Americana” and “Distressed Americana” archetypes in MGI’s previous research.

 — Suburbs and exurbs. We refer to the 271 counties that make up the extended suburbs of US 
cities as urban periphery. This category includes places such as San Bernardino, CA, and 
Arlington, VA. Home to about 17 percent of the US population but just under 12 percent of all 
Black Americans, they have attracted people moving out of dense urban settings in search 
of more space. In most of these counties, a significant share of the population commutes into 

22

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesnearby urban areas. Healthcare, retail, logistics, and local services are large parts of these 
local economies, which have the highest median household income of all community profiles. 

 — Mixed middle. This category includes 180 stable cities (such as Cincinnati, Jacksonville, and 
St. Louis) and 94 smaller independent economies (such as Lancaster, PA, and Winston-
Salem, NC). These places have slow economic and job growth, higher unemployment, and 
moderately educated workforces. Stable cities are home to 12 percent of the US population 
but 19 percent of all Black Americans.

 — Low-growth and rural areas. More than 2,000 rural counties are home to just over 18 percent 

of the US population and 15 percent of all Black Americans. We divide them into two 
categories: somewhat better-performing places (stable rural counties such as Cameron, 
TX, and Caddo Parish, LA) and struggling areas (trailing rural counties such as Coahoma, 
MS, and Danville, VA). In these segments, populations are older, unemployment is higher, and 
educational attainment is lower than the national average.  

Black Americans are not evenly concentrated across community profiles
As Exhibit 3 shows, 30 percent of Black Americans live in megacities (notably in New York; 
Atlanta; Washington, DC; and Chicago). Just under 20 percent make their homes in stable 
cities, where they have shaped the culture and history of places like Baltimore, Birmingham, 
Detroit, and New Orleans. While these two community profiles are home to half of all Black 
Americans, only 35 percent of all Americans and a quarter of White residents reside in them. This 
concentration of Black residents reflects historical patterns (see sidebar “Black migration, past 
and present”).

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesSmaller but significant shares of Black residents live in the urban periphery—that is, in America’s 
extended suburbs. Additionally, 15 percent of Black Americans live in rural areas, both stable and 
trailing rural counties. Our report also focuses on two other community profiles where the share 
of the Black population has been growing: independent economies and high-growth hubs.

There have been small shifts in the distribution of Black residents between community profiles 
over the past decade (Exhibit 4). The Black population grew faster than the general population 
in the urban periphery, partly reflecting ongoing Black movement to the suburbs. In parallel, the 
three community profiles where Black residents are overrepresented saw decreases in the Black 
share of the population by county on average.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes  
  
Black migration, past and present

The geography of Black America today 
did not come about by happenstance. It 
has been drawn and redrawn by historical 
events and human responses to them. 

The continued concentration of Black 
Americans in the South is a legacy of the 
nation’s slaveholding past. To this day, more 
than half of the nation’s Black residents 
are found there.1 However, with the end of 
Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow, 
many Black residents chose to leave behind 
the racial terrorism and poverty of the 
South. They packed up and headed to cities 
in the North, Midwest, and West, hoping to 
land better jobs in factories booming with 
demand from World War I. 

This domestic diaspora, known as the Great 
Migration, continued through another world 
war and on through the 1970s. It eventually 
saw some six million Black Americans fanning 
out into wider swaths of the country in search 
of economic opportunity.2 They established 
communities in many major cities, urbanizing 
the Black population for the first time. In the 
process, they created thriving cultural hubs 
in places from Harlem to Detroit that would 
redefine American music, literature, art, and 
culture more broadly. 

Many of these Black migrants, though not all, 
did manage to better their circumstances. Yet 
racism and discrimination existed beyond the 
South.3 These forces crystallized in the form of 
housing segregation ordinances in cities across 
the country, and when the Supreme Court 
struck down this type of measure, local officials 
began using housing codes and restrictive 
covenants as ways to enforce segregation.4 

As postwar prosperity faded, some urban 
neighborhoods beyond the South with heavily 
Black populations became places with 
entrenched economic challenges (a topic we 
explore in chapter 2). In the 1960s and ’70s, 
Black Americans tended to be hit harder in 
places that lost bedrock industries, with effects 
that often compounded and calcified over 
time.5 More recently, the wave of globalization 
that began in the 1990s saw almost 650,000 
Black manufacturing jobs disappear; Black 
workers have remained underrepresented in 
manufacturing ever since.6

Leaving was not and is not an easy option 
for impoverished residents. As the Great 
Migration taught, it takes money to move in 
search of better opportunity, and it can be 
wrenching to leave family and the familiar 
behind. Even today, it is not surprising to see 
better outcomes for Black residents of high-
growth hubs, since most of these counties 
are not home to large Black communities that 
have suffered intergenerational poverty.8  

The next generation of Black Americans has 
begun its own migration trends, in a shift from 
the patterns of the 20th century. Research has 
shown that some Black Americans are saying 
goodbye to places like New York, Chicago, 
and Los Angeles. Many have headed back 
to the Sunbelt, contributing to population 
growth especially in Texas, Georgia, and North 
Carolina.9 As in the earlier historical wave, this 
movement has brought new vibrancy to Black 
communities. National cultural influences now 
often emanate from places such as Atlanta.10 

As some of the nation’s urban areas became 
environments with few opportunities 
and many challenges, policy makers and 
Americans outside these communities 
often turned away, portraying the issues as 
intractable.7

The first Great Migration led to better 
economic outcomes for many Black 
families, at least for the first generation 
who headed north.11 Whether the new 
Great Migration south will lead to the same 
remains to be seen.12

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesAcross community profiles, we assess Black outcomes against a set of 
aspirations for all residents, regardless of race 

Our work is grounded in a set of aspirations for all residents, regardless of their race, to thrive and 
reach their full potential. These aspirations encompass a range of common socioeconomic topics 
from existing research on economic opportunity and racial equity, including research related to 
how equity outcomes vary across geography.40  

By definition, we do not assess topics that are specific only to Black residents, such as anti-
Black discrimination. Because we examine community settings ranging from urban to rural, we 
also do not assess topics that are illogical to compare across places of different density (such as 
distance to public parks, community institutions, or neighborhood amenities). Last, we do not 
assess outcomes related to climate risk. However, we do note recent McKinsey research showing 
that roughly half of all Black Americans reside in 11 Southeastern states with high exposure 
to extreme heat, hurricanes, and flooding.41 This means our findings likely understate the true 
disparities between Black and White US residents.

That being said, our approach, which assembles a statistical fact base, reveals concrete, 
quantifiable disparities between Black and White residents. It could be extended to assess 
inequities that other people of color experience.

What are these aspirations for every American household, regardless of where they live? This 
research is predicated on the hope that everyone can:

 — Meet a basic standard of living, free from hunger and poverty

 — Achieve financial stability, with access to economic resources and financial services

 — Access job opportunities that offer decent pay and good working conditions

 — Enjoy a long and healthy life, supported by affordable, quality care for their physical  

and mental well-being

 — Access opportunities to develop capabilities and skills through affordable,  

quality education

 — Live in a stable and secure home that is affordable

 — Have both physical and virtual connectivity thanks to reliable infrastructure

 — Enjoy stable communities, with residents who are present and can engage in  

their neighborhoods

These conditions are about more than surviving. They aim to capture what it takes to thrive, or for 
individuals to feel secure about their lives, their futures, and the futures of their families. When 
outcomes are good across all of the dimensions listed above, people are equipped to realize 
more of their innate potential, wherever it may take them. People of all races who responded 
to McKinsey’s 2021 American Opportunity Survey echoed the importance of many of these 

40  As noted above, we reference existing research and tools such as the Brookings Institution and NAACP’s Black Progress 
Index, the Brookings Metro Monitor, PolicyLink’s National Equity Atlas, the Urban Institute’s Spatial Equity Tool, the 
Opportunity Atlas, and the Loving Cities Index. We also draw inspiration from the Urban Institute’s Upward Mobility Framework 
(upward-mobility.urban.org/mobility-metrics-framework) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Education-to-Workforce 
Indicator Framework (usprogram.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are/education-to-workforce-framework). See also, for

respondents were least likely to agree that most people have opportunities to find good jobs, 
and they reported greater financial struggles, with higher levels of credit card and medical 
debt. They were likelier than other groups to mention access to transportation and broadband 
as barriers. More than 20 percent were concerned about their ability to secure nutritious food 
and healthcare.

27

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesFor each of the aspirations articulated above, we identify two to four priority metrics as proxies 
conveying how all residents, and especially Black residents, are faring (Exhibit 5).43 For example, 
to measure “long and healthy lives,” we assess life expectancy, health insurance coverage, and 
overall physical and mental health for both Black and White residents of each US county. These 
quality-of-life aspirations are of course more nuanced than a few proxies can capture, but by 
employing a substantial number of metrics, we are able to present a reasonably clear picture of 
outcomes—and of gaps. We give each aspiration equal weight in assessing overall outcomes in 
each community profile.44

43  These metrics were chosen not only because of their relevance but also because of their consistent availability across 

counties, which enables us to make comparisons. For more detail on the metrics and our sources, see the separate technical 
appendix.

44  There is a subtle weighting toward economic outcomes simply because of the number of aspirations and metrics used; 
however, this is in keeping with the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility’s focus on economic inclusion.

28

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesUsing a geographic lens is important. Many of the interventions that could improve outcomes for 
Black residents are best conceived and delivered by local institutions (such as state and local 
governments, local businesses, and grassroots efforts). The challenges in a dense urban setting 
may differ from those in a rural community, and the solutions may need to differ as well. In the 
next chapter, we explore the degree of prosperity and parity that Black residents experience 
across various community profiles and across our set of aspirations.

29

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes2. The current 
state of outcomes 
and equity for 
Black residents 

The communities in which people live can affect their economic opportunities, their 
physical and mental health, their quality of life, and their sense of belonging. Community 
environments are the product of culture and history, but they can also be influenced by 
government actions, fiscal resources, housing conditions, social and physical infrastructure, 
physical design, and the industries that are present. The character and prosperity of a place are 
also affected by who moves into and out of it over time.45  

Consider a child who grows up in a well-to-do neighborhood. She attends preschool programs, 
then excellent public schools with a range of extracurriculars. The prevailing expectation 
surrounding her is that high school graduates will go on to college. Her parents and neighbors 
have good-paying jobs and keep their homes well tended. This child’s environment increases her 
odds of a healthy and prosperous adulthood. 

By contrast, consider a child with the same intrinsic ability and motivation who grows up 
in an economically distressed community. She may be less likely to attend preschool. Her 
underperforming neighborhood school may have a high dropout rate. Unstable employment and 
housing are commonplace. Some children who grow up in these types of communities can and 
do beat the odds, but they have to travel a harder road to do so.46  

45  See, for example, Matthew Carmona, “Place value: Place quality and its impact on health, social, economic, and environmental 

outcomes,” Journal of Urban Design, volume 24, issue 1, June 2019; David Adams and Steve Tiesdell, Shaping places: 
Urban planning, design and development, Routledge, 2013; Emil Malizia et al. Understanding local economic development, 
Routledge, 2020; and Claudia Coulton, Brett Theodos, and Margery A. Turner, “Residential mobility and neighborhood

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesThis research takes a closer look at how these types of effects play out in counties across the 
United States. Specifically, this chapter examines the extent to which residents achieve the key 
aspirations articulated in chapter 1 (long and healthy lives, a basic minimum standard of living, 
financial stability, decent and affordable housing, good job opportunities, quality education, 
reliable infrastructure, and stable communities). Putting all of these dimensions together, we 
find substantial variations in overall outcomes for Black residents across different community 
profiles—as well as meaningful gaps between the outcomes for Black and White residents (see 
sidebar “Our approach”).

Black outcomes are generally better in suburban and high-growth areas  
where Black residents are underrepresented
In broad terms, outcomes for Black residents are most positive in communities with stronger 
economic foundations (Exhibit 6). 

This is especially true of the urban periphery, which includes places such as Hancock County 
outside of Indianapolis, Brazoria County outside of Houston, and Rockdale County outside of 
Atlanta. The nation’s extended suburbs have the highest overall Black outcome scores. They 
have the top scores for measures of standard of living, job opportunities, and stable community, 
as well as the second-highest scores for metrics of financial stability, long and healthy lives, 
education, and stable and secure homes. 

Yet these prosperous suburban and exurban settings are home to a limited number of Black 
residents, or about 12 percent of all Black Americans. This figure captures a steady increase 
in Black suburban representation over the past 30 years, but it is still five percentage points 
lower than the share of the total US population that lives in the urban periphery.47 Moreover, 
positive outcomes in the suburbs reflect the economic circumstances of the Black residents who 

47  On the diversification of the suburbs, see, for example, William H. Frey, Today’s suburbs are symbolic of America’s rising 

diversity: A 2020 census portrait, Brookings Institution, June 2022; and Sophia Tareen, “Black population continues to grow in 
suburbs and shrink in cities across the U.S.,” Los Angeles Times, March 4, 2022.

Our approach

Across every US county, we assess the 
overall prosperity and well-being of 
all residents and of Black Americans 
in particular, using a standard set of 
metrics (most of which are gleaned from 
government statistics). For each of the 
aspirations articulated in this research, we 
calculate two scores:1   

 — Black outcomes: This indicates how 
Black residents in a given county are 
doing relative to the average for Black 
residents across the nation. These 
scores reflect all of the individual 

metrics associated with a given 
aspirational category, weighted equally. 

 — Parity: This indicates how far a county 
is from achieving equivalent outcomes 
for Black and White residents across 
all metrics in a specific aspirational 
category.

For both scores, higher values are more 
desirable. The maximum value for a Black 
outcome score is 100, indicating better 
outcomes for Black residents in a given 
county relative to their peers across the 

nation. Parity scores are measured as 
ratios, with 1.00 representing perfect 
equality; scores closer to 1 therefore 
indicate smaller Black-White disparities. 

We then aggregate results, assigning each 
county to one of the community profiles 
described in chapter 1. This enables us 
to compare outcomes across types of 
American communities. 

For more detail on our methodology, see 
the separate technical appendix. 

1  Using a scoring method allows for easier comparison between metrics that use different units (years or dollars, for instance).

can afford to live there. Urban periphery counties have the highest Black household incomes 
($79,000) among the seven community profiles in our focus; this holds even when adjusted for 
cost of living.48  

Even in these more prosperous settings, however, Black residents face affordability challenges. 
Rent burdens are nearly as high as those in major cities: 46 percent of Black urban periphery 
residents spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent, compared to 49–51 percent in the 
urban core community profiles. High median suburban home values also put homeownership out 
of reach for many. A third of urban periphery counties have median home values over $300,000, 
with some of the most expensive median values topping $1 million. While Black homeownership 
rates are higher in the urban periphery than in any community profile except trailing rural 
counties, only 52 percent of these Black suburban residents own their homes (compared with

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes78 percent of White urban periphery residents). Notably, urban periphery counties perform 
poorly on measures of connectivity, reflecting the distant locations and car-centered design of 
many suburbs and especially exurbs. Some 23 percent of Black residents of the urban periphery 
commute longer than 45 minutes.

An important note on these outcomes is the fact that more than half of urban periphery 
counties are located in proximity to megacities and high-growth hubs, which have the nation’s 
highest GDP. People who live on their edges naturally benefit from access to these economies 
as well as their infrastructure and amenities. But suburban residents lie outside the financial 
jurisdiction of cities, which often means they do not have to manage the economic burdens of 
urban environments, such as higher poverty and food insecurity.49 Suburban residents who do 
experience poverty, however, may encounter patchier safety nets, lower philanthropic support, 
and otherwise limited assistance than low-income city residents.50  

The second-highest Black outcome scores are in high-growth hubs (places such as Las Vegas 
and Seattle). Yet just over 6 percent of Black Americans live in these economically dynamic 
communities. Underrepresentation is notable in places such as San Jose/Silicon Valley, CA, and 
Austin, TX, that have high-growth, high-wage industries.51 While these places produce relatively 
high overall Black outcomes, their cost of living makes it difficult to gain a foothold there, which 
explains the relatively low ranking for financial stability and the poor ranking for housing.   

Black Americans are overrepresented in two urban community profiles where their outcomes are 
mixed. Roughly 30 percent live in megacities (a category that includes Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, 
Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco, and 
Washington, DC). These urban areas have strong economies but more uneven outcome scores. 
In addition to having high costs of living, they have the highest share of Black residents with 
long commutes (29 percent) and with outsize rent burdens (51 percent). By contrast, megacities 
rank first in developing skills, with high shares of Black residents who have college degrees 
(28 percent) and the highest preschool enrollment rate (44 percent). They rank second in job 
opportunities, with high unemployment but also a large share of Black workers in management 
roles (36 percent).

Almost 19 percent of Black Americans live in less dynamic stable cities, where housing 
affordability is a challenge and median incomes tend to be lower ($52,000). These cities rank 
poorly on financial stability as a result, although lower costs of living make incomes go further. 
They also rank poorly on health and longevity. Perhaps due to economic and environmental 
stressors, Black life expectancy in stable cities (74 years) is three to four years lower than in 
other community profiles. These urban areas also have some of the highest proportions of Black 
residents with self-reported poor physical and mental health in the past month when surveyed 
(13 to 17 percent).

49  A long line of academic literature has established the economic relationship between cities and suburbs, and debated the 
question of whether and how suburbs should help finance city services. See, for example, Andrew F. Haughwout, Robert P. 
Inman, and J. Vernon Henderson, “Should suburbs help their central city?” Brookings–Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs, 
2002; and Andrew F. Haughwout and Robert P. Inman, “How should suburbs help their central cities? Growth- and welfare-
enhancing intra-metropolitan fiscal distributions,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, volume 
626, issue 1, 2009; and Peter Dreier, John Mollenkopf, and Todd Swanstrom, Place matters: Metropolitics for the twenty-first 
century (revised), University Press of Kansas, 2014.

50  See, for example, Elizabeth Kneebone, “The changing geography of US poverty,” Brookings Institution, February 2017. On the 
diverse economic experiences of Black suburban residents in particular, see Kimberley S. Johnson, “‘Black suburbanization: 
American dream or the new banlieue?” The Cities Papers, 2014.

51  See, for example, Jana Kadah, “San Jose experiences a ‘Black exodus,’” San Jose Spotlight, October 10, 2023; and Alcynna 

Lloyd, “A 24-year-old Black tattoo artist explains why she and many others are fleeing Austin: ‘The soul of the city has 
changed,’” Business Insider, March 12, 2023.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesOutcomes in megacities and stable cities may reflect the history of large cities enacting 
biased policies or providing uneven levels of public services across neighborhoods, locking in 
disadvantages or lowering the quality of life for many Black residents. For example, research 
has shown that two-thirds of housing developments in the greater Columbus, OH, area in the 
1920s and ’30s had exclusionary covenants against Black residents.52 Similarly, Black residents 
of Chicago public housing, such as Cabrini–Green, were found to have been discriminated 
against throughout the 1950s and ’60s by being placed at outsize rates in developments that 
were almost exclusively built in segregated, underserved neighborhoods.53 Even when historical 
wrongs are addressed (as these were, through judicial decisions), their effects can linger in 
communities for many years.

The two rural community profiles—stable rural counties (think Marion County, FL, and Cameron 
County, TX) and trailing rural counties (such as Robeson County, NC, and Barbour County, 
AL)—rank near last on most Black outcomes. Poverty and food insecurity rates among rural 
Black residents range from 28 to 32 percent. Lower life expectancies (74 to 75 years) may reflect 
challenges such as limited access to quality healthcare.54 Metrics such as incarceration rates and 
broadband access also indicate poor outcomes; for example, 22 to 28 percent of Black residents 
in these rural communities lack internet subscriptions. However, rural communities do rank highly 
in housing (driven by lower rent burden, higher homeownership rates, and less overcrowding). 
Stable rural counties also are in the middle of the pack in financial stability. But notably, Black 
Americans are underrepresented in these more prosperous rural counties: 13 percent of all US 
residents live in stable rural counties, but only 9 percent of Black US residents do. By contrast, 
about 5 percent of the US population lives in trailing rural counties, but these places are home to 
6 percent of Black US residents. 

Virtually nowhere in the United States are outcomes for Black residents  
equal to those of their White neighbors
Considering the resident experiences of Black Americans relative to those of White Americans 
yields a few striking findings.

First, no US county with a significant Black resident population has achieved parity—or even 
come close.55 Only 37 US counties with more than 25 Black residents are close to parity, 
which we define as having a parity score of at least 0.90 (meaning that Black outcomes are 
90 percent of White outcomes across the metrics we analyze). Collectively, these 37 counties 
are home to just 39,000 Black residents, or 0.1 percent of the Black US population (Exhibit 7).56 
Furthermore, more than 33,000 of these residents live in the one urban periphery county with 
a parity score above 0.9: Paulding County, GA, in the outskirts of the Atlanta metropolitan 
area, where both Black and White households earn above-median incomes (about $81,000 
and $85,000, respectively). Six other urban periphery counties located outside of Atlanta, 
Houston, and San Antonio have parity scores that are just slightly lower (between 0.85 and

0.90) and sizable Black populations (ranging from 13,000 to 205,000).57 Almost all other 
counties approaching parity are rural areas that score near the bottom on absolute outcomes 
for all residents.58 Effectively, nowhere in the United States are outcomes for Black residents 
equal to those of their White neighbors.

Disparities are widest in the two community profiles where most Black Americans live 
Black–White parity gaps are largest in megacities and stable cities, which are collectively 
home to about half of all Black Americans (Exhibit 8). Black residents of megacities earn 
roughly 60 percent of what White residents do. The gaps in Black and White commute times 
in megacities are notable, showing the difficulty for many Black residents to secure homes 

57  Six other urban periphery counties are similar to Paulding County, GA, in having sizable Black populations (greater than 
10,000) and comparable though slightly lower parity scores (between 0.85 and 0.90). Four are also in the Atlanta metro 
area: Clayton, Douglas, Rockdale, and Newton counties. The remaining two counties are in Texas: Brazoria County outside of 
Houston, and Guadalupe County outside of San Antonio. Generally speaking, these counties are home to Black residents who 
earn similar incomes to their White neighbors (mainly above-median incomes, with some exceptions); they are accessible to 
major metropolitan areas by highways (if requiring long commutes); and they have seen growth in their Black populations (and 
decline in their White populations) over the past decade.

58  The 37 counties with at least 25 Black residents and parity scores of 0.90 or above include 18 trailing rural counties, nine 
rural outliers counties, seven stable rural counties, and one county each in the stable cities, urban periphery, and small 
powerhouses community profiles. Twenty-seven of these counties have fewer than 100 Black residents.

in neighborhoods that would be more convenient.59 Longer commutes not only take a toll on 
physical and mental health (and potentially on wallets); they also eat into the time people can 
spend with their families.60 Stable cities have racial gaps in many areas similar to those seen in 
megacities, with megacities’ last-place ranking in connectivity reflecting disparities in car access 
(2.4 times as many Black households as White households lack access to a car) and in broadband 
subscriptions (2.2 times). 

In addition, high-growth hubs, another urban community profile with better Black outcome 
scores, perform worse on parity, particularly when it comes to long and healthy lives, developing 
skills, and stable and secure homes. These large parity gaps across high-growth hubs,

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesmegacities, and stable cities speak to the greater degree of racial inequality that exists in US 
urban areas.61 

As noted above, the urban periphery has the highest overall Black outcome scores. This 
category also stands out for ranking second overall for parity. Yet even in these counties, 
only 64 percent of the gap between Black and White outcomes has been closed, on average. 
These are communities with moderate Black representation, the best outcomes for Black 
Americans, and above-average performance on parity—and they still have an overall outcome 
gap of 34 percentage points. Even in categories in which the urban periphery ranks at or near 
the top among community profiles, such as standard of living and financial stability, gaps in 
specific metrics are sobering. Compared with their White counterparts, Black residents of the 
urban periphery have a poverty rate that is 2.2 times higher; they are 3.0 times more likely to 
experience food insecurity; and they earn roughly 16 percent less. This is only one example, but it 
underscores the significant work still needed across every part of the United States.

The only community profiles that match or exceed the urban periphery’s average parity scores 
are stable and trailing rural counties. But as noted above, these rural areas have the lowest 
average outcomes for Black residents—meaning that higher parity reflects poor outcomes for 
all residents of these communities (and on top of that, Black rural outcomes lag behind White 
outcomes). In cases like these, as well as in many urban settings, higher Black outcomes and 
parity can appear to present a trade-off (Exhibit 9). 

Overall, no community profile or individual county has produced best-in-the-nation outcomes 
for Black residents across the full range of metrics. Every place has its own mix of successes and 
challenges. Most cities and counties are checkerboards of neighborhoods with highly unequal 
incomes (and therefore resources). In many of them, some areas have adequate or even excellent 
services, amenities, and infrastructure, while other areas are neglected. Our analysis of Black 
resident outcomes across community profiles does not examine these more granular variations 
across different local neighborhoods and lived experiences. Moreover, in any neighborhood, the 
resident experience is shaped by elements of identity beyond race, such as disability, gender 
identity, sexuality, national origin, ethnicity, and citizenship status.

However, our findings offer insight into the overall degree of prosperity and parity that Black 
residents experience in different kinds of US communities. An exceedingly small number live in 
places that have relatively high levels of parity and positive Black outcomes. 

61  Previous research has identified considerably greater inequality in urban areas, including greater inequality between racial 
groups. Consider the example of median incomes: the US Black median household income is $46,800, or about 62 percent 
of the median for White households, which is $75,000 (based on the 2021 American Community Survey one-year estimates 
from the US Census Bureau). In San Francisco, median Black household incomes were similar, at $46,000, but median White 
household incomes were $162,000—meaning Black San Francisco residents earn only 28.5 percent of what White San 
Francisco residents do. See Katharine Swindells, “Income in US cities is most unevenly distributed in a decade,” City Monitor, 
December 2022.

Above, we noted that only 37 counties with more than 25 Black residents have closed at least 
90 percent of the gap between their Black and White residents as measured by comparing their 
outcomes. Looking more broadly at all US counties, without this limitation on population or the 
90 percent cutoff, some 4.7 million Black Americans (out of a total population of 40 million) live 
in counties with top-decile Black outcome scores. Only about 630,000 live in counties with top-
decile parity performance. The overlap between these groups is quite small. Only 192,000—or 
0.5 percent of the US Black population—live in counties that place in the top decile on both 
measures (Exhibit 10). The rest live in places where White residents are considerably more 
prosperous than their well-off Black neighbors. In other words, enjoying both prosperity and 
parity is a rarity for Black Americans.

Enjoying both prosperity and parity is a rarity for Black Americans.

There are approximately 
40 million Black Americans

One square = 
10,000 Black Americans

More than 4.7 million live in 
the 314 counties with 
top-decile performance for 
Black outcomes1 

Around 630,000 live in the 314 
counties with top-decile 
Black-White parity scores2

Only 192,000 
Black Americans (0.5% of 
the Black US population) 
live in counties with 
top-decile performance in 
Black outcomes and parity3

1The top decile for prosperity includes counties with Black outcome scores of 66 or greater.
2The top decile for parity includes counties with parity scores of 0.84 or greater.
3More than 90% of these residents live in just four urban periphery counties: Charles County, MD, outside of Washington, DC (about 77,900 Black residents); Brazoria 
County, TX, outside of Houston (~54,000); Paulding County, GA, outside of Atlanta (~33,200); and Guadalupe County, TX, outside of San Antonio (~13,200).

Communities that are thriving can often sustain a virtuous cycle, as prosperous residents 
strengthen local tax bases, ensuring that resources can flow back into neighborhoods and 
schools. By contrast, places with histories of economic exclusion and inadequate public budgets 
may be caught in a vicious cycle that compounds over time. This dynamic is reflected in the 
following chapter, which considers the pace of change over the most recent decade and projects 
into the future.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes3. The pace 
of change

Chapter 2 showed the current state of Black outcomes and Black–White parity across  
our aspirations in different types of communities. But are things at least trending in the 
right direction? 

To answer this, we examine data from a decade ago to quantify whether American communities 
have been making meaningful progress—or, in some cases, whether they have lost ground. We 
do find multiple metrics improving for Black residents, especially in urban America. 

Yet our analysis shows that general improvements in outcomes for Black residents have not 
moved the needle on parity. Where Black outcomes improved, White outcomes improved to the 
same degree or even more, meaning that gaps did not narrow. Unless American communities 
can begin to make more dramatic progress in improving prosperity and the quality of life for their 
Black residents, these issues will remain for future generations. 

While this research compares places in terms of absolute and relative outcomes over time, we 
do not attribute specific changes to resident actions or government policies, which would be 
infeasible given our national scope. We do consider population change over time but do not 
isolate migration (either domestic or international) as a quantifiable factor. 

What does all this mean? Places with better and more equitable outcomes for Black residents 
could have produced those outcomes through local policies or programs. But they are also 
places where more affluent Black people may have self-sorted, or places that less affluent Black 
people may have moved away from due to rising costs of living. Similarly, places with steadily 
deteriorating outcomes could have challenging macro conditions or poor governance. But this 
is intertwined with the fact that more economically secure Black residents can leave, while their 
more vulnerable peers cannot; this tends to create environments of concentrated poverty with 
fewer opportunities for gainful employment.62 We hope this research can fuel conversation about 
the imperative to meet Black residents where they are—that is, improving outcomes within their 
current communities, regardless of whether they have the means or the desire to move in search 
of something better.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesOutcomes for Black residents generally improved over the 
past decade, but unevenly and with some exceptions
First the good news: progress, though not always swift, did occur for Black residents in most 
types of American communities over the past decade. Overall Black outcome scores improved 
in 73 percent of US counties, which are collectively home to some 34 million Black residents. 
(For more on county-level results, see sidebar “A more granular view.”) Stable cities, trailing rural 
counties, and high-growth hubs experienced the largest gains in overall Black outcome scores, 
which rose about 6.5 percent on average from 2012 to 2021 (Exhibit 11).

The drivers of improved Black resident outcomes
Looking more closely at the changes driving these outcomes reveals differences across 
community profiles: 

 — Stable cities: Progress over the past decade was driven by improvement in job opportunities 
(including lower unemployment and a shift away from Black representation in service roles 
and toward management roles); stable and secure homes (with a reduction in the rent 
burden); and stable communities (with reductions in both vacancy and incarceration rates). 

 — Trailing rural counties: These counties saw a similar degree of overall improvement as 

stable cities. Here, progress reflects increases in the standard of living (with the largest 
reductions in poverty and food insecurity); long and healthy lives (reflecting increased 
insurance coverage, and the largest increases in both physical and mental health); and stable

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes 
Acknowledging the pandemic’s influence on our results

We use 2021 data to analyze the current 
state of Black and White resident 
outcomes since that is the most recent 
date for which county-level information 
was available for all metrics. In this chapter, 
where we discuss change over time, we 
look back from 2012 to 2021.

Our results are a snapshot of a time that 
was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It is important to note that the pandemic 
had outsize negative effects on Black 
Americans. Black residents were nearly 
twice as likely to live in counties at highest 
risk of health and economic disruption 
during the early peak of the pandemic.1 
These included urban areas that were hit 
first and hardest by the virus, followed by 
some rural regions with patchier access to 
healthcare resources. 

Job opportunity data may also be affected. 
In a McKinsey survey from the summer 
of 2020, 36 percent of Black Americans 

reported negative impacts on their 
employment (versus 29 percent of White 
Americans).2 The Black unemployment 
rate peaked at 16.9 percent in April 2020, 
matching highs not seen since March 
2010 (when the Black employment rate hit 
16.8 percent in the aftermath of the Great 
Recession).3 Black children also sustained 
higher levels of unfinished learning, since 
they were less likely to have access to 
digital devices, internet access, and live 
contact with teachers.4  

However, in other ways, the pandemic may 
have spurred changes that led to gains 
for Black Americans. Health insurance 
coverage, for example, grew not only due to 
Affordable Care Act expansion but also due 
to revised eligibility for Medicaid as part 
of the pandemic response, which could be 
reflected in our data.5  

While we do not have complete county-
level data for 2022 and 2023, it is worth 

noting some national-level trends. With the 
official end of the COVID-19 public health 
emergency, millions have lost Medicaid 
coverage in a trend that is expected to 
grow.6 This puts the coverage gains in our 
results at risk (not to mention the potential 
impact on health outcomes for individuals 
who lose coverage). The strong recovery 
in the labor market drove the Black 
unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent 
as of December 2023; however, this is 
still above the White unemployment rate 
of 3.5 percent.7 In addition, the impact 
of COVID-19 lingers in the form of lower 
life expectancy for all races. According 
to the latest Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) statistics, Black life 
expectancy at birth fell from 74.8 years 
in 2019 to 70.8 years in 2021; White life 
expectancy also declined but sustained a 
smaller drop over this period, going from 
78.8 to 76.4 years.8

communities (reflecting lower incarceration rates). Trailing rural counties also saw the largest 
jump in connectivity, reflecting improved broadband access for Black residents of these 
counties. This is a welcome development for places where lack of Wi-Fi has been a serious 
challenge for participating in the economy. However, improved metrics in trailing (and stable) 
rural counties need to be understood in context, since rural counties generally had lower 
baseline starting points and remain behind other community profiles on most metrics.

 — High-growth hubs and megacities: Both of these community profiles stand out for increases 
in financial stability, driven by rising Black incomes, and in skill development, driven by higher 
bachelor’s degree attainment and fewer Black residents who started college but did not 
graduate. These increases are partly the result of the industries and types of skilled jobs that 
tend to cluster in these urban economies. But they could also reflect the profiles of Black 

44

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesgraduates or workers who may be more likely to move into these areas to take advantage 
of those opportunities. Some researchers have noted a “brain drain” phenomenon in rural 
America, with college graduates often leaving in search of better jobs. In effect, skill gains in 
rural communities may eventually translate into better urban outcomes.63 

 — Independent economies, stable rural counties, and urban periphery: These community profiles 
made either average or slower progress across all our aspiration categories. It is worth noting, 
however, that the areas where the urban periphery made the smallest gains over the decade—in 
health, housing, and connectivity—are also areas where it was already a top performer. 

Shared challenges
Community profiles share some common challenges. All saw declining Black homeownership and 
increasing commute times. Longer commutes may be attributable to increased displacement and 
gentrification around hubs of activity, with higher housing costs pushing poorer and middle-class 
Black families farther away from places of work and community engagement.64 

Other common challenges likely resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most community profiles 
saw reduced Black labor force participation rates, except for megacities and high-growth 
hubs, where there was almost no change.65 Black preschool enrollment rates also declined 
everywhere except in high-growth hubs, reflecting a nationwide trend shaped by both school 
closures and some parents’ decisions not to send their children to school.66 A final common 
challenge was in Black residents’ self-reported mental health, which declined across almost 
all community profiles (except trailing rural counties)—consistent with national declines during 
the pandemic.67 (For more on the impacts of the pandemic and post-pandemic trends, see 
“Acknowledging the pandemic’s influence on our results,” earlier in this chapter).

Results are mixed when it comes to progress toward racial parity 
Within the seven community profiles that are home to 90 percent of the Black population in the 
United States, Black outcomes improved in most counties. But only about half of those counties 
reduced the gaps between outcomes for Black and White residents (as discussed in the sidebar 
“A more granular view”). 

The quality of life is improving on multiple dimensions for everyone, whether through economic 
and demographic forces or intentional policies—a trend that is worth celebrating. Yet progress 
has been slower to filter through to Black residents. Their gains have not been sufficiently rapid 
or dramatic to erase the effects of disadvantaged starting points. In short, progress does not 
automatically produce parity or even put the nation on a trajectory to achieve it. It is also worth 
noting that our data does not cover the accumulation of wealth; taking it into account would add 
yet another dimension with considerable racial gaps.68

65  Approximately 67 percent of all US counties registered a decline in Black labor force participation rates over the period we 

analyzed. For more on this dynamic, see Andreas Hornstein and Marianna Kudlyak, “The pandemic’s impact on unemployment 
and labor force participation trends,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, April 2022. On the recovery of overall labor force 
participation as of 2023, see “Labor force participation rate for people ages 25 to 54 in May 2023 highest since January 
2007,” The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2023.

“School enrollment rates of 3- and 4-year-olds returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022,” US Census Bureau, November 2023.

67  Approximately 65 percent of all counties saw a decline in the share of Black residents self-reporting good mental health. As 

noted in the separate technical appendix, due to data availability, we examine the change in mental health between CDC surveys 
administered in 2018 and 2020; this is a shorter period than we examine for most other metrics, and one that may coincide more 
closely with the impacts of COVID-19. On the uptick in poor mental health during the pandemic, as well as its impact on Black 
Americans in particular, see Nirmita Panchal, Heather Saunders, and Nambi Ndugga, “Five key findings on mental health and

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesA more granular view

While this research considers community 
profiles with some common characteristics, 
those groupings are not monoliths. Each 
one is a collection of individual counties, 
each with its own variations in outcomes. 

While roughly three-quarters of counties 
have shown improvements in overall 
outcomes for Black residents, only about 
half—home to roughly 28 million Black 
residents—made strides toward racial 

parity (exhibit). High-growth hubs and 
megacities had the greatest share of 
counties with rising overall Black outcomes 
and narrowing gaps between White and 
Black residents. By contrast, less than half 
of stable and trailing rural counties made 
the same kind of progress. 

improved in only 57 percent of urban 
periphery counties, but this community 
profile ranks second overall for increased 
parity over the past decade. When looking 
at averages across categories, gains in 
some counties may offset stagnation or 
backsliding in others.

This serves as a reminder of the diverse 
experiences across counties within each 
community profile. For example, parity

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesOver the past decade, megacities and the urban periphery made the largest improvements in 
parity (Exhibit 12), although their gaps in outcomes for Black and White residents shrank by only 
about 4.2 to 5.5 percent overall. The nation’s best balance of positive overall Black outcomes and 
narrowing gaps seems to be found in its suburbs and exurbs. Yet, as noted above, progress toward 
parity was not universal; 43 percent of urban periphery counties had stagnant or widening gaps.

This view of change over time shows trailing rural counties starting and finishing the decade with 
the highest level of parity among the seven community profiles in our focus, closing racial gaps 
by about 3.9 percent overall. But as discussed above, these economically struggling rural parts 
of the United States also deliver the poorest overall outcomes for all residents, and for Black 
residents in particular. Moreover, Black residents of more prosperous stable rural counties saw 
the smallest improvements in parity, with racial gaps shrinking by only 1.7 percent overall. 

Progress toward parity across each aspiration
In addition to considering overall parity gaps, it is instructive to look at racial gaps across each 
of the aspirations articulated in chapter 1 (long and healthy lives, standard of living, financial

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesstability, stable and secure homes, job opportunities, opportunities for skill development, 
connectivity, and stable communities). This view shows that gaps between White and Black 
residents have narrowed only slightly—and in most community profiles, some gaps have widened 
or barely budged over the most recent decade (Exhibit 13). 

Areas of progress 
In four of the aspirational categories, there was at least some progress toward parity across all 
seven community profiles.

 — Standard of living: Rates of poverty and food insecurity for Black residents ended the 

decade lower in relation to the rates for White residents.

 — Stable homes: While there was a growing racial gap in homeownership across all seven 
community profiles, this was offset by narrowed gaps in rent burdens and overcrowding. 

 — Connectivity: There was mixed progress in racial disparities in commute time, although racial 
gaps shrank across the board in households without car access and without a broadband 
subscription. Notably, trailing rural counties saw the least progress: expanded broadband use 
among Black households, while welcome, was closely matched by that of White households. 

 — Stable communities: Most places saw narrowed racial gaps in incarceration and vacancy 

rates (although stable rural counties saw almost no movement on either metric, and trailing 
rural counties saw widening disparities in vacancy rates).

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes 
Areas of stagnant or worsening disparity
The other aspirational categories generally saw either limited progress or widening disparities 
over the last decade.

 — Financial stability: Racial disparities in household income widened across rural America and 

in stable cities and high-growth hubs; elsewhere, there was scarcely any movement. 

 — Job opportunities: Racial gaps in unemployment and labor force participation narrowed 
slightly in most community profiles, but gaps in the shares of Black and White workers in 
management roles widened. There was little overall change in this category as a result. 
The one exception to this is trailing rural counties, which saw a notable reduction in the gap 
between Black and White workers in service roles.

 — Long and healthy lives: Gaps in the uninsured share of the Black and White populations 

widened in cities, narrowed in rural areas, and remained little changed in the urban periphery. 
Progress was mixed across community profiles for disparities in self-reported physical 
health, although we do observe narrowing gaps in mental health across the board.69  

 — Skill development: Racial gaps in bachelor’s degree attainment improved slightly in all 

community profiles, but disparities in residents who started college but did not graduate 
worsened. Moreover, gaps between the Black and White populations without high school 
diplomas barely changed. 

At current rates of change, how long would it take to 
achieve both improved outcomes and racial parity? 
We explored some hypotheticals to put the recent pace of change in context and to describe 
where Black residents would likely land in the future unless progress accelerates. 

Bringing Black outcome scores across the country to the level of today’s top performers
First, we consider how long it would take to lift all other Black residents to the levels of prosperity 
and well-being enjoyed by those in the urban periphery (currently the top-performing community 
profile for Black residents). At the current pace of change, it would take all other community 
profiles anywhere from 10 to 30 years to catch up with America’s suburbs and exurbs in absolute 
outcomes for Black residents (Exhibit 14). Since the recent rate of change has been fastest in 
cities, they would catch up sooner, while rural communities could take the longest. 

Importantly, average Black suburban outcomes are not the ceiling for Black prosperity. 
Some Black residents do better still in individual counties (for example, several counties in 
the Washington, DC, area stand out for having large Black populations and top-tier Black 
outcomes).  It would take up to 2.5 times longer for all community profiles to reach similar levels 
of prosperity.70 

69  This finding contradicts other research identifying worsening racial disparities in mental health over the period we study 

(namely as affected by the pandemic). See, for example, Mieke Beth Thomeer, Miles D. Moody, and Jenjira Yahirun, “Racial 
and ethnic disparities in mental health and mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Journal of Racial and Ethnic 
Health Disparities, volume 10, issue 2, April 2023. This discrepancy may reflect differences in data collection or methodology, 
or it may reflect changes that manifested later in the pandemic, as the CDC data we use to capture current state outcomes is 
from 2020.

70  Fourteen of 24 counties in the greater Washington, DC, metropolitan area have top-decile performance for overall Black 

outcomes, and 11 of these also have more than 10,000 Black residents.

The timeline to racial parity
Second, we estimate the time it would take for Black Americans to reach parity with their White 
neighbors in various dimensions if recent rates of change hold steady into the future. This 
assumption gives us a stark picture. 

Despite some recent improvements, based on the rate of change between 2012 and 2021, it 
could take more than three centuries for all community profiles to reach parity for Black and 
White residents at the current pace of progress. In megacities and stable cities, where nearly half 
of America’s Black population lives, it would take 160 to 240 years for Black residents to catch 
up with White residents if improvements do not accelerate. For simplicity, this analysis holds 
outcomes for White residents the same, although history indicates that they are likely to continue 
improving. The implication here is that the true number of years is likely even greater. 

In short, recent improvements have taken a small chisel to a large mountain of past inequities 
that have accrued over time. Unless change accelerates, the United States would not achieve 
racial parity in our lifetimes—or even in our children’s or grandchildren’s lifetimes (Exhibit 15).

It has been said that justice delayed is justice denied.71 Similarly, glacial progress in leveling the 
playing field denies Black residents both economic and social opportunities. Since the resident 
experience has cascading effects on Black Americans in their roles as workers, consumers, 
savers, and business owners, the United States is shortchanging the broader economy when 
millions of residents face barriers to reaching their full potential. Bringing fresh energy to 
engaging on solutions is the only way to ensure that these challenges and disparities are not left 
to linger for future generations.

71  In the context of the struggle for racial justice in the United States, this statement is most famously associated with Martin 

Luther King Jr.’s 1963 “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”

51

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes4. Solutions 
with scale

The differing outcomes for Black residents and the slow pace of progress toward racial 
parity described in this research lead to the question of what can be done to change this 
picture. How can communities move closer to realizing basic aspirations for a better quality of 
life for all residents? 

As described in the previous chapter, the United States is currently on a trajectory that could take 
decades to improve outcomes and more than three centuries to get to racial parity. Dramatically 
accelerating that timeline would mean upending the status quo. Both existing and innovative 
solutions are needed at mass scale, with a commitment to sustain them over time. They also need 
to resonate with the people they seek to serve, with the voices of Black leaders and communities 
helping to shape programs. To transform the quality of life for Black residents and create a more 
equitable society, the United States will need fast, bold, and effective interventions on a bigger 
scale than anything attempted before.

But where to start? 

One option is to take a place-based approach, investing in a range of initiatives within specific 
communities. The Harlem Children’s Zone is a notable example of this approach, offering 
comprehensive “cradle-to-career” programming for low-income children and families with 
an emphasis on educational achievement.72 Other examples include the East Baltimore 
Development Initiative, Atlanta’s East Lake Foundation, and San Diego’s City Heights Initiative.73 
Several national nonprofits support local efforts by offering funding and expertise. For instance, 
StriveTogether leads the Cradle to Career Network, linking 65 local community partnerships 
committed to improving student outcomes; Purpose Built Communities helps local leaders 
promote holistic development with a focus on mixed-income housing; and the Government 
Alliance on Race and Equity brings together state and local governments.74 Place-based 
investment can also be led by public-sector entities (such as the US Department of Education’s 
Promise Neighborhoods program) and philanthropic funders (for example, Blue Meridian 
Partners’ national “Place Matters” portfolio, the Walton Family Foundation’s support for

Foundation’s work in Detroit, Memphis, and New Orleans).75 

Another option is taking a thematic approach with the aim of improving specific outcomes across 
many communities. Any number of initiatives could pave the way toward the social and economic 
outcomes all Black residents deserve. Exhibit 16 lists several that touch on some of the primary 
areas where we found widening parity gaps: financial stability, job opportunities, health and 
longevity, and skills development. Across each of these aspirations, the parity gap has grown or 
barely budged over time across nearly all community profiles. We also include stable housing, 
where we identified mixed progress toward parity, because it is a growing issue with profound 
impact on residents’ quality of life. All of these priorities would require substantial investment but 
have the potential to generate real returns to individuals and society as a whole.

This chapter delves deeper into two of these priority areas: affordable, long-term housing and 
a comprehensive birth-to-kindergarten care infrastructure, with an emphasis on getting more 
children into preschool. Overall access and equitable access differ across community profiles 
(Exhibit 17). Yet these two issues are pressing near-term needs across the board, and both 
have broad stakeholder buy-in. In a recent YouGov poll, some two-thirds of respondents said it

is difficult to find affordable housing in their area.76 Childcare is similarly being recognized as a 
national priority, not only for families but also for employers.77 Addressing these two issues can 
have almost immediate benefits, including positive spillover effects on multiple aspects of well-
being. They would benefit all residents but also set the stage for improving racial parity over the 
longer term, since Black residents are disproportionately affected by the status quo, whether 
through lack of access or cost burden. Our discussion further highlights the different approaches 
that could be appropriate across community profiles and the question of balancing better 
outcomes for all with greater parity.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes 
 
 
 
Affordable housing and early childhood education also address outcomes and equity from 
another angle: they are priorities that can benefit Black women in particular. Just over 30 percent 
of all Black Americans live in female-headed households, and more than 20 percent of all 
Black women are living in poverty.78 In California alone, some 59 percent of Black women are 
rent burdened, and one-third are severely rent burdened (that is, they spend more than half 
of their income on housing).79 Black women are more likely to face eviction, and for those who 
head households, the resulting experience is often traumatizing for both themselves and their 
children.80 Providing stable, affordable housing and easing the cost and logistics of childcare 
could relieve two major sources of financial and personal stress for Black women, giving them 
more flexibility to participate in the labor force while also giving their children a better start in life. 

Quality affordable housing is a critical foundation for Black residents  
Having a place to call home is a foundational human need.81 An extensive body of research 
has established the spillover benefits of affordable, quality housing and the neighborhood 
environment on residents’ financial stability, physical and mental health, physical security, and 
commutes.82 Affordable housing initiatives can also be a powerful lever for reducing child poverty, 
which is an outsize problem for Black residents (Black children are about three times more likely 
to experience poverty than White children, even after accounting for tax credits or government 
transfers).83 Tackling the affordable housing shortage—particularly by expanding affordable 
housing in low-poverty neighborhoods and as part of mixed-income developments—would help 
improve educational outcomes and economic mobility for the next generation.84

The scarcity of affordable housing has reached crisis proportions in the United States.85 Rents 
and home prices have risen far faster than incomes in many parts of the country, with the 
number of rent-burdened metro areas (those where rent consumes more than 30 percent of 
household monthly income) increasing sevenfold since 1999.86 This issue is particularly acute 
in places with the strongest job growth. The soaring cost of housing in these local economies, 
in part due to zoning restrictions, effectively blocks low-wage workers from accessing higher-
paying opportunities.87

Across the United States, about half of all renter households spend more than 30 percent of 
their income on housing, and a quarter spend more than 50 percent (which defines them as

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomes“severely cost burdened”).88 By contrast, only 22 percent of homeowners are either moderately 
or severely cost burdened. Together, these dynamics make housing unaffordability particularly 
acute for Black residents, who are both less likely to own homes and more likely to feel a squeeze 
on their monthly budgets (Exhibit 18). Rent burdens are still high among Black homeowners, 
at 30 percent—but for the majority of Black households who rent, almost twice that share 
(57 percent) are cost burdened. 

Overspending on housing reduces what families have left over for healthcare, education and 
enrichment activities, transportation, and savings for emergencies and retirement; it often leads 
to difficult decisions and doing without. One recent study found that families without stable 
housing were 40 percent more likely to face food insecurity.89

estimated a shortage of 4.3 million homes based on an analysis of families living with nonrelatives in homes they themselves 
did not own or rent. See Sam Khater, “Housing supply: A growing deficit,” Freddie Mac, May 2021; and Orphe Divounguy, 
“Affordability crisis: United States needs 4.3 million more homes,” Zillow, June 2023.

57

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesneeds of extremely low-income renters across the country. (Importantly, the lack of affordable 
housing for this group is a critical driver of the overall housing shortage; most extremely low-
income renters have no choice but to rent homes that are unaffordable for them but that would be 
affordable if rented to slightly higher-income tenants.91) Adding this number of units could involve 
building about 365,000 new affordable units annually for the next 20 years. 

This scale of building activity is not out of reach. In fact, the United States nearly met that 
number in 2022, with 342,000 new multifamily rental builds. Yet only about 5 percent of those 
new units were offered with affordable rents.92 While increasing the supply of market-rate 
housing in a neighborhood can help lower rents, a large share of the market is nonetheless 
going unaddressed as many developers focus on upscale projects where they see higher  
profit potential.93

We estimate that the total investment required to construct the needed units could run 
anywhere from $1.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion. To arrive at the lower figure, we assume an average 
cost of $187,000 to $313,000 to build a 1,000-square-foot apartment in low-, mid- and high-
rise developments, mapped against the potential need for each kind of development across 
community profiles.94 Using another approach in which we examine the average cost reported by 
states and cities to build affordable units, the average cost ranges from $178,000 to $600,000 
per unit.95 This results in the higher estimate (see sidebar “The financing challenge”).96 By way 
of comparison, these estimates are close to the size of the first COVID crisis relief package in 
2020.97 Note that this is only for building the 7.3 million additional affordable rental units needed 
to meet the shortage estimated by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Additional 
funding would also be needed for renovating existing properties and providing rental assistance 
(not to mention investing in expanded homeownership opportunities).

There is a clear need to find ways to change the economics and add to the supply of affordable 
units through some combination of policies, new financing mechanisms, increased public and 
social finance, partnerships, and greater productivity in the construction sector.98

How do the challenges and solutions differ in urban areas?
In major cities that are already dense, a scarcity of land drives up its cost. In some, this 
scarcity is exacerbated by constraints due to terrain (such as coastlines and mountains) or 
zoning regulations (such as height limits, minimum lot sizes, and parking requirements for new 

91  Extremely low-income renters are defined as households with incomes at or below either the federal poverty line or 

30 percent of area median income, whichever is higher. Andrew Aurand et al., The gap: A shortage of affordable homes, 
National Low Income Housing Coalition, March 2023.

92  In this instance, units with affordable rents are defined as having rents lower than $1,050 per month. The state of the nation’s

93  On the effect of new housing supply on housing affordability, see Shane Philips, Michael Manville, and Michael Lens, The effect

Angeles, February 2021.

94  Building cost estimates based on Hannah Hoyt and Jenny Schuetz, Making apartments more affordable starts with 

understanding the costs of building them, Brookings Institution, May 2020. We use poverty rates across all US community 
profiles as a proxy to estimate the likely distribution of need for affordable housing in markets where low-, mid-, or high-rise 
housing developments are more likely to be constructed.

95  Range based on reported average building costs for 15 states and cities in different regions of the United States. As with our 
previous estimate, we use poverty rates across community profiles to estimate how much need exists in higher versus lower 
cost markets.

96  This is based on a simplifying assumption for costs. In practice, building costs could run far higher in some of the nation’s most 

expensive markets.

97  See, for example, “What’s in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package?” Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,  

March 2020.

98  Low productivity in the construction sector is a consistent problem not only in the United States but worldwide. The sector has 
averaged only 1 percent annual productivity growth over the past two decades, compared with 2.8 percent for the total world 
economy and 3.6 percent in the case of manufacturing. Some of the solutions for jump-starting performance include greater 
adoption of digital tools and new building techniques, standardizing projects, and introducing more industrialized approaches 
(such as modular and prefab construction). See Reinventing construction: A route to higher productivity, McKinsey Global 
Institute, February 2017.

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesThe financing challenge

While the estimated cost of building 
sufficient new affordable units to meet 
the current need involves an enormous 
sum, it is important to remember that 
this is investment that yields returns to 
developers, while the projects themselves 
generate jobs and economic activity. But 
some public capital may be needed to help 
projects pencil out. 

Financial institutions, social investors, 
and philanthropic funders can also help to 
design and scale up new financing models, 
such as community-invested real estate 
investment trusts. Community land trusts 
are another option; in this model, the trust 
retains ownership of land on behalf of a 
community and sells only the buildings that 
sit on the land to qualified buyers.1

Major employers, too, have incentives to 
get involved with housing, since shortages 
directly affect their ability to attract new 
workers and cut down on commuting  
time for their existing workforces. 
Companies such as Disney, JBS, and  
Meta have begun to focus on their 
employees’ housing needs.2

Financing for an affordable housing 
project can involve lining up multiple types 
of government funding and tax credits, 
philanthropic support, and loans. Each 
source may have its own administrative 
burden and timeline, which increases 
complexity. Cities and states can bring 
greater coordination and predictability 
to this process. For example, they could 
offer a single digital application portal that 
consolidates all public funding sources 

(and that potentially tracks philanthropic 
and private funding sources as well).

Recent legislation, including the Inflation 
Reduction Act and the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, has allocated more 
federal funding for affordable housing 
initiatives.3 The challenge now will 
be putting that money to work in the 
most effective and equitable ways to 
meet the needs of Black residents and 
communities—and recognizing that even 
more sustained work and investment will 
be needed. These one-time infusions, 
while welcome and large in scale, are not 
wholly sufficient to erase shortfalls and 
gaps that are also large in scale and have 
been compounding for many years.

oppose new multifamily builds that would increase density even more. This is also an issue in 
growing suburban communities.100

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesredline, vocal community pushback and legal challenges that stall or block affordable housing 
units effectively produce the same results, keeping low-income families locked out.102 Opposition 
is particularly fierce when it comes to building transitional or supportive projects for people 
experiencing homelessness, a large share of whom are Black.103

All of these compounding effects are straining Black urban households. In megacities, high-
growth hubs, and stable cities, our analysis found that approximately half of Black households 
are rent burdened. Megacities have the greatest residential overcrowding problem of all seven of 
the community profiles in which 90 percent of Black Americans live. 

Previous McKinsey Global Institute research has highlighted ways to accelerate construction  
of affordable housing in urban areas.104 These strategies are not exhaustive, but they include  
the following:

 — Unlocking land. MGI has estimated that unlocking land to the fullest extent could reduce 
the cost of owning a standard housing unit by up to 20 percent.105 Many cities and state 
government agencies are sitting on parcels of publicly owned land that could be earmarked 
for housing. They can also allow bigger developments around transit, which will hopefully 
reduce commutes and congestion, and adjust regulations to maximize what is built on private 
land. One approach that helped Houston jump-start affordable housing construction was 
reducing its minimum lot size.106 Smaller lot sizes are one example of “light-touch density” 
housing, which has been found to positively affect housing supply and affordability.107 Infill 
housing can also be built on vacant parcels. Detroit’s mayor has proposed taxing vacant lots 
and buildings, contending that it would not only create an incentive to build but would also 
address blight, which is a particular issue in stable cities.108

 — Dismantling regulatory barriers. Well-intended approval processes can add delays, which 
increase development costs. A dedicated government unit with a mandate to accelerate 
housing delivery from end to end is one potential solution, perhaps with fast-track permitting 
for affordable projects.109 Other ways to remove barriers and reduce delays include large-
scale zoning changes that permit more multi-tenant developments (including nontraditional 
formats) and simplified building codes. 

 — Investing in social housing. Public housing was once a major part of federal housing policy 
in the United States, and it is the norm in places such as Singapore and Vienna, Austria. 
Montgomery County, MD (which is part of greater Washington, DC), has adopted Vienna’s 
approach of mixed-income public housing, which uses rents paid by higher-income tenants 
to subsidize affordable units.110 Legislation to develop public housing is under consideration 

102  See, for example, Jaimie Ross and Kody Glazer, “Overcoming NIMBY opposition to affordable housing,” 2022 Advocates’ 
Guide, National Low-Income Housing Coalition; Corianne Payton Scally and J. Rosie Tighe, “Democracy in action? NIMBY 
as impediment to equitable affordable housing siting,” Housing Studies, volume 30, issue 5, 2015; and Conor Dougherty, 
“Twilight of the NIMBY,” New York Times, June 5, 2022.

109  One national-level example of this approach comes from the American Planning Association and the National League of 

Cities, which have formed the Housing Supply Accelerator to enable communities and developers to increase and improve the 
quality of housing stock (an overview is available at planning.org/housing-supply-accelerator/).

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesin other places around the country.111 Another effective tool is allowing developers to build 
bigger projects in exchange for setting aside a certain percentage of units for low-income 
renters. This can be an effective way to both increase the supply of affordable housing in 
mixed-income settings and ensure that housing gets to those who need it.112

 — Converting commercial spaces. In the post-pandemic world of remote work and reduced 
demand for commercial space, developers can work with cities to convert properties into 
housing (while revitalizing downtown areas at the same time). As MGI has noted, conversions 
are logistically difficult and may expand residential space by only a small percentage.113 Yet 
as many distressed properties are being sold to international investors at a discount, there is 
a potential missed opportunity for social investment.114 Shifting opportunity costs may make 
conversion a more popular option going forward.

Rural America may need a different housing approach
While the scarcity of land is a major driver of the housing crunch in dense cities, rural areas have 
the opposite problem. They have land, but their more fragmented nature and smaller populations 
can make it difficult to attract capital. 

It can be harder for large-scale developments to pencil out in rural counties. These regions 
can prioritize rehabbing existing homes and repurposing existing structures that have been 
abandoned. This type of effort can inject new life into main streets that have been withering 
away. Economic development programs could also jointly prioritize housing and transportation 
investments in rural areas, taking advantage of more land area and less density.115 Just as in 
cities, however, private developers are more likely to add market-rate housing; some kind of 
public or philanthropic element may be needed to build affordability into such revitalizations.116

Rural counties can also find ways to pool projects in portfolios to achieve scale. Some state 
and federal programs are promising. One example is the US Department of Agriculture’s Rural 
Development Program, which offers low-income homeowners grants and low-cost loans for 
repairs. The agency regularly partners with Habitat for Humanity chapters to bring people into 
their programs and to carry out renovations and new builds.117

What are other ways stakeholders can affect housing?
Across community profiles, actors can undertake several other strategies to improve  
housing outcomes. 

Along with private and public developers, nonprofits can build or acquire affordable housing. 
Mercy Housing, for example, opened seven new housing communities in 2022, adding 1,000 
units to its portfolio.118 The group acquires and renovates residential communities to preserve 
affordable housing that already exists but might be lost when owners sell. Another example 
comes from Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit whose Faith-Based Development 
Initiative works with houses of worship to convert underutilized church-owned land into 
affordable homes. Enterprise recently announced a partnership with the nondenominational

housing could help solve the affordability crisis,” NPR, February 5, 2020; and Aitor Hernández-Morales, “How Vienna took 
the stigma out of social housing,” Politico, June 30, 2022.

new affordable homeownership and rental opportunities.119

Builders of all kinds can also begin to adopt prefab construction, which involves producing 
standardized components of a structure off-site in a factory setting. MGI has estimated that 
this can reduce the development cost of multifamily housing by 5 to 15 percent.120 In downtown 
Los Angeles, for example, a 232-unit interim housing project for people experiencing 
homelessness was built in just four months using prefab modular units (including repurposed 
shipping containers).121 

Adding more affordable housing units is a prerequisite to achieving the aspiration of all Black 
residents having safe and secure homes. But the push to build needs to be undertaken with 
an eye toward racial parity so that the revitalization of underserved neighborhoods does not 
lead to displacement. Even affordable new builds can spark gentrification. One study found 
that gentrification, primarily in megacities, caused the displacement of 135,000 households of 
color from 2000 to 2013.122 Projects would need careful community input and fair processes for 
allocating new units, balancing the needs of new arrivals and current Black residents. 

Building and renovation are not the only ways to secure housing for Black families. Financial 
assistance for homebuyers and renters can be impactful as well. Today most rental assistance is 
delivered through federally funded Section 8 vouchers, but the program has issues with long wait 
lists and tenants struggling to find landlords who will accept them.123 In addition to addressing 
these issues, other policies, such as tax credits, could lower the financial burden of rent for low-
income families. Tax credits can also broaden access to mortgages, along with strategies such as 
down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.124

Once residents are connected to affordable housing, it is equally important to keep them in 
their homes. Many community groups provide legal assistance to low-income renters, but these 
efforts can be scaled up dramatically. Emergency rental assistance funds can also be a lifeline 
that prevents families from falling into homelessness. 

Finally, there is an opportunity for public-sector stakeholders to close the racial gap in people’s 
experiences of government services related to housing. In McKinsey’s State of the States 
benchmark survey of nearly 80,000 Americans, Black respondents were more likely than 
White respondents to report recent use of government services related to affordable housing 
assistance but less likely to report a positive experience (Exhibit 19).125

Early childhood education prepares Black children for academic and  
professional success
High-quality early childhood development programs can change the trajectory of 
disadvantaged children’s lives. In addition to gaining an academic foundation, children learn 
to cooperate, regulate themselves, and take care of themselves. Early childhood education is 
similarly effective in mitigating the impacts of child poverty on a range of economic, social, and 
physical outcomes.126

Enrolling all Black children in high-quality early childhood programs could be a major step 
forward in parity. For example, in New York City, the racial achievement gap in standardized 
test scores for third graders was significantly reduced for the first cohort of students to attend 
universal preschool.127 This effect can be long-lasting. One study following attendees of Child-
Parent Centers in Chicago found that, later in life, they had higher educational attainment, lower 
rates of substance abuse and incarceration, and greater economic well-being than peers who 
did not attend.128

Childcare is also critical to parents’ ability to work and provide for their families. Half of both 
Black and White families pay for childcare, but this eats up 23 percent of Black families’ income 
on average, versus 15 percent for White families.129 This can leave many Black parents with the 
dilemma of either spending an unsustainable amount on childcare or exiting the workforce—
which can affect their lifetime earning potential. Full-day, state-funded pre-kindergarten 
lightens this load, at least once children are of preschool age: a randomized study in Washington,

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesDC, found a ten-percentage-point increase in maternal labor force participation after the city 
introduced universal pre-K.130

Formal childcare and pre-K can also deliver more structured developmental opportunities 
than informal caregiving. All children, regardless of background, gain greater language skills 
and experience social, emotional, and cognitive benefits from interacting with classmates of 
different backgrounds.131 Universal programs have a higher likelihood of achieving this diversity 
than targeted or means-tested programs, since they are open to everyone and have simpler 
application processes. Indeed, low-income families are more likely to enroll in a universal 
program than a targeted program for which they are eligible.132 And finally, universal programs 
that benefit all children are more likely to enjoy broad and sustained support.133

What is the scale needed to get universal pre-K, and what might it cost?
As of 2022, 53 percent of children aged three to four were enrolled in preschools, representing 
a strong recovery from pandemic-era lows (including among Black children).134 However, this 
means some 3.5 million children in that age group are not in preschool. 

While enrollment in state-funded preschool has more than doubled over the past two decades, 
only one-third of four-year-olds (and 6 percent of three-year-olds) are being reached by public 
preschool programs; most of those who do attend are in privately funded programs.135 If we aspire 
to the goal of all children being able to access to high-quality public preschool, the estimated 
need increases to a total of six million more student places. 

This also implies the need for another 614,000 educators and paraprofessionals, and a cost of 
some $78 billion annually.136 This is based on a study estimating the cost of high-quality, full-
day pre-K at $12,700 per child, a figure that approaches national spending per child on K–12 
education.137 This also reflects the cost of full-day programs, since studies have shown that they 
produce better student outcomes as well as making life easier for working parents.138

The cost is also crucially linked to attracting and retaining childcare workers and preschool 
teachers with dedicated training in early childhood care and education—and ensuring that

134  Enrollment data based on the 2022 Current Population Survey and including all children of each age enrolled in “nursery 
or kindergarten.” Enrollment rates for all races dropped during the pandemic, but Black children saw larger declines than 
their White peers: Black preschool enrollment fell to 39.6 percent in 2021 (compared with 53.0 percent in 2019), whereas 
White preschool dropped only from 53.2 percent to 46.0 percent over the same period. In 2022, however, Black preschool 
enrollment among three- and four-year-olds surpassed that of all other races, jumping to almost 62 percent. Whether these 
gains will persist remains to be seen. See Adrienne Griffiths, “School enrollment rates of 3- and 4-year-olds returned to pre-

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesthese professionals receive living wages.139 Black women make up about 17 percent of the early 
childhood workforce, meaning that equitable pay in this industry could also be an investment  
in their upward mobility.140 Investing in quality early childhood instruction could also help 
address the reality that, today, many Black children who are enrolled in preschool may be in 
lower-quality programs.141 Research has shown that poor-quality early childhood education can 
actually be detrimental, and quality goes hand-in-hand with teacher qualifications.142 Success 
depends on the interactions between teachers and students, and on both teachers’ and 
students’ well-being.143  

Average state spending per child is only about half the estimated cost required to provide high-
quality pre-K, a level that has barely budged in two decades.144 To fund high-quality programs, 
states would need to narrow this gap, which is no small challenge. In fact, cuts are being 
proposed to Head Start, the national program that supports early learning and development, 
health, and family well-being for low-income children under five. In addition, COVID-era federal 
funding is coming to an end; this is creating what has been called a “childcare cliff,” with more 
than 70,000 centers serving 3.2 million children at risk of closing.145

If stakeholders can find the resources to expand access to preschool, the returns could be 
substantial. Nobel laureate James Heckman has shown that high-quality early childhood 
programs for disadvantaged children can deliver a return on investment of anywhere from 
7 to 13 percent. This estimate factors in better outcomes for enrolled children (who go on to 
contribute more tax revenue and require fewer public services over their lifetimes) as well as 
higher incomes for their mothers.146 However, there is an inherent time-horizon mismatch at work: 
the costs of programs are incurred today, but the full payoff comes over the long term, in ways 
that are not always easy to measure.147 Nevertheless, in jurisdictions across the country, voters 
have been approving various types of tax increases to fund high-quality public programs.148

139  Average wages vary depending on classroom setting and instructor qualifications, but early childhood education 

professionals across the board tend to earn considerably less than their peers who teach kindergarten. One analysis found 
that an early childhood teacher with at least a bachelor’s degree earns $18.77 per hour—only 57 percent of what they might 
earn teaching kindergarten ($32.80 per hour). Maureen Coffey, Still underpaid and unequal: Early childhood educators face 
low pay and a worsening wage gap, Center for American Progress, July 2022.

140  Maureen Coffey, Still underpaid and unequal: Early childhood educators face low pay and a worsening wage gap, Center 

for American Progress, July 2022. In addition to addressing low wages for all early childhood education teachers, there is a 
further opportunity to address racial disparities within the profession: Black early childhood educators earn 78 cents less  
per hour than their White peers. This more than doubles to a gap of $1.71 per hour when comparing Black and White women 
who work with preschool-age children (which tends to pay more than working with toddlers and infants). See Caitlin McLean

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesUrban areas are making strides in early childhood education, but equity remains a challenge
Some states are working toward universal preschool. The most recent annual report from the 
National Institute for Early Education Research finds that Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, Vermont, 
West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have achieved this. It notes that Georgia, 
Illinois, Maine, and New York have established goals for universal preschool but have not 
yet fully implemented it. California, Colorado, Hawaii, and New Mexico have recently passed 
legislation to make pre-K available to all, and the governors of Michigan and New Jersey have 
announced their support.149

Dozens of the nation’s largest cities are innovating in early childhood education, moving even 
faster than states.150 San Antonio set an early example after approving a sales tax to fund 
high-quality pre-K in 2012, a commitment the city renewed in 2020. Its preschool program 
requires bilingual abilities among its teachers and actually offers slightly higher pay than the 
K–12 system. Jacksonville, Atlanta, and Tulsa have maximized the impact of state-level funding 
for accessible pre-K and have been able to serve most of their four-year-old residents.151 Cities 
such as Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Denver, and New York further invest local funds on top 
of what is provided by their respective states. More recently, places such as Anchorage, New 
Orleans, and Multnomah County, OR, have passed ballot measures to fund more expansive early 
childhood education.152

Cities have some advantages when establishing or expanding early childhood programming; they 
can build on the presence of colleges and universities, and larger school systems, for example. 
Density and transit mean that preschools and childcare sites are generally more accessible, 
although density also makes it more expensive to build new capacity in these areas. 

Importantly, universal commitments in principle do not automatically create universal access 
for families in practice; nor do they guarantee universal quality. States and cities need to muster 
enough funding, teachers, and operational capacity. Inequality in major cities is reflected in 
the fact that not every child who tries to enroll is able to do so, and parents without resources 
or information are least likely to navigate the systems successfully.153 Simplifying application 
processes and boosting parental awareness through comprehensive family outreach campaigns 
could help to improve parity.154

Rural communities could shift from informal care to programs that deliver 
developmental benefits
The challenges are somewhat different in rural areas. One study found that rural children were 
entering kindergarten with fewer academic skills and less readiness than their peers in smaller 
cities and suburbs. These outcomes were partly explained by the fact that rural families are 
more likely to rely on informal home-based preschool (or care provided by family members) than 
on formal programs with trained teachers.155 Nearly two-thirds of rural families live in “childcare

deserts.”156 Small populations may make it hard for private providers to stay afloat.157 Furthermore, 
the long distances involved potentially mean fewer convenient choices for families; programs 
may even need to provide transportation.

Scaling up programs can be a particular challenge for these rural communities. Local agencies 
and school systems may need to pool disparate funding streams. Awareness among parents is 
also critical; families simply may not know if free public pre-K exists. Indiana, for example, has 
a family outreach program designed to boost pre-K enrollment, with dedicated funding to push 
the effort beyond the state’s largest cities and into rural areas.158 There also may be scope for 
rural communities to scale quality, publicly funded pre-K provided in home-based childcare 
settings, which could better meet the needs of less densely populated areas.159 (This strategy 
could similarly make sense in urban communities where it is more economical to run home-based 
programs than to build larger centers.) Notably, many Black and Latino families prefer home-
based care settings, and such programs are more likely to be run by Black and Latina women.160

Where can stakeholders step in?
Gaps in pre-K will persist across the nation, in all types of communities, unless and until greater 
and more sustained public funding materializes. Other nations make these commitments; a 
recent international study by UNICEF ranked the United States in the bottom 15 percent of all 
high-income countries in both the access and affordability of early childhood education.161 As 
long as early childhood education is a patchwork proposition, achieving parity in access and 
outcomes for Black children will be harder. 

Some cities have shown that rapid progress is possible.162 But in many places, advocating 
for system-level change is a long game—and every year, children can’t afford to wait. In the 
meantime, the private sector and philanthropists can fill some of these gaps. 

The struggles of working parents during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent tightness in 
the labor market have led some employers to offer childcare subsidies as a benefit.163 A small but 
growing number, including Hormel, Marriott, Micron Technology, Patagonia, Tyson Foods, and 
Walmart, are going even further to offer their own on-site daycare and pre-K programs. While 
these require a serious commitment, they inspire loyalty and reduce turnover.164

156  A childcare desert is “an area where there are at least three young children for every licensed child care slot—or no licensed 
child care providers at all,” as defined in Leila Schochet, “5 facts to know about child care in rural America,” Center for 
American Progress, June 2019. Based on our categorization of community profiles, more than six million Black residents live 
in rural areas.

particularly likely to work at unlisted home-based childcare providers: this workforce is 21 percent Black and 23 percent 
Latina (in contrast to 17 and 14 percent, respectively, among the center-based workforce). See Marcy Whitebook et al., Early 
childhood workforce index 2018, Center for the Study of Child Care Employment, University of California, Berkeley, 2019.

162  Washington, DC, for example, committed to expanding its two-year, universal preschool program in 2009, and by 2017 had 
enrolled approximately 90 percent of four-year-olds and 70 percent of three-year-olds. Boston’s mayor announced a goal 
in 2005 of providing preschool for all four-year-olds; by 2010, 85 percent of district schools had a preschool classroom. 
(The city continues to expand access, with a $20 million investment announced in July 2022 and new opportunities for 
community-based childcare providers to be part of Boston’s universal pre-K program announced in March 2023.) New 
York City launched its Pre-K for All program in the fall of 2014 and rapidly scaled capacity: by 2016, there were more than 
70,000 seats in public school and community-based preschool programs, up from about 19,500 in 2013. See Rasheed

The state of Black residents: The relevance of place to racial equity and outcomesMore support can be unlocked from philanthropy. One recent report noted that while few 
philanthropists currently prioritize early childhood education, their willingness to give rises 
dramatically when they see evidence of its impact on well-being and learning outcomes. 
Individuals and foundations with the resources to make a difference are out there; giving them a 
fact base and clear funding opportunities could mobilize them.165

As with affordable housing, the public sector also has an opportunity to improve customer 
experiences for residents who engage with state services to use childcare or find childcare 
centers. McKinsey’s State of the States benchmark found that Black residents across all states 
were almost twice as likely as White residents to interact with state services in order to find or 
utilize childcare services, but notably less likely to have a positive experience when doing so 
(Exhibit 20).166

While this chapter has focused on two of our aspirations for Black residents, work is obviously 
needed on many fronts. Our hope with this research is to illustrate the scale of solutions that are 
needed and to emphasize the importance of tailoring those solutions to each community context. 
While the path to better outcomes for Black residents is long, and the path to parity even longer, 
the journey could be shorter if stakeholders step in and step up. No matter where they live, all 
Black residents across the nation should be able to thrive.
