Nature and financial 
institutions in Africa: 
A first assessment 
of opportunities 
and risks

June 2022

About FSD Africa and the African Natural Capital Alliance (ANCA)

FSD Africa carried out this joint research to support the work of the African Natural Capital Alliance (ANCA). ANCA is an 
African-led collaborative forum for mobilising the financial community’s response to the risk of nature loss in Africa which is 
being supported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the United Kingdom’s Department for 
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).

Foreword

As underlined in the sixth report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
African countries are among the most vulnerable 
to climate change and have the least capacity to 
respond to climate risks and to climate-related 
disasters. This vulnerability is compounded by 
Africa’s exposure to external economic shocks.

This report aims to strengthen Africa’s resilience by 
proposing opportunities to redefine the continent’s 
economic model to sufficiently leverage its natural 
capital, and by helping to redesign Africa’s financial 
system so that critically needed investments can be 
made in nature, climate resilience, and associated 
opportunities to improve livelihoods. Such changes 
are needed because over 60 percent of Africa’s 
population directly depend on ecosystem services, 
naturally occurring services that benefit humans, 
such as the provision of food and water, for their 
essential needs and livelihoods. 

Perhaps more than in any other region, successful 
strategies to advance Africa’s Sustainable 
Development Goals will require significant nature-
positive investments, that is, investments which 
support net additions to the natural capital upon  
that not which people rely for services. Such nature-
positive investments could have a three-fold return 
on investment – namely, a financial, environmental, 
and social return. First, recent studies by the United 
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) 
have confirmed that nature-based solutions to 
climate change – such as rehabilitating wetlands 

and mangroves, as well as sustainably managing 
forest resources – can yield a high return on 
investment. Second, nature-positive investments by 
definition strengthen the natural environment and 
improve the provision of natural ecosystem services 
and often add to Africa’s contribution to climate 
change mitigation. Third, these strategies can 
also contribute significantly to livelihoods, through 
enhanced food and fibre production and related 
manufacturing. In particular, a high proportion of the 
African population directly depend on sectors that 
are highly dependent on nature for their income and 
sustenance, and it is these individuals that might 
benefit the most.

Tapping into this opportunity requires collaboration 
between governments, development partners, and 
the private financial sector. That is because nature 
is relevant to nearly all sectors of the economy and 
reversing nature loss will require the definition of 
new products and markets, as well as substantial 
net investment. We look forward to working with all 
partners to develop this opportunity to its fullest – 
to deliver growth and resilience, both globally and 
locally.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksContext 

This report applies, for the first time, a 
quantitative risk assessment and stress-
testing framework for financial institutions to 
the opportunities and risks relating to nature. 
It builds on the pioneering nature-related risk 
assessments undertaken by Banque de France and 
De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), which estimated 
the share of assets held in the French and Dutch 
financial systems considered at high risk from 
nature loss. The analysis in this report extends this 
approach to quantify how the value of financial 
assets would change under scenarios of future 
action on climate and nature. The scenarios define 
a series of plausible narratives and goals, and the 
assessment considers how the actions needed to 
reach those goals would impact the performance of 
financial portfolios.

The emerging findings offer proof that it is 
possible for financial institutions to assess 
nature-related opportunities and risks and that 
these are material. Globally, this report is the 
first to present the results of applying the Locate, 
Evaluate and Assess stages of the Taskforce on 
Nature-related Financial Disclosures’ (TNFD) LEAP 
approach to a private financial institution’s portfolio 
and to a national financial system. In doing so, it 
offers an example of what is feasible in Africa, and 
thus of what is feasible across much of the world. It 
also shows that nature-related opportunities and 
risks are material in Africa, a region with high growth 
opportunities and globally important natural capital. 

This assessment describes the changes in 
asset values and company-level financial 
performance that might result from nature-
related opportunities and risks. Using new data 
sets and tools, this study evaluates the degree to 
which companies impact and depend on nature, 
and how nature affects their business activities, 
including their supply chains. It estimates how these 
factors influence average company-level financial 
performance over time, sector by sector, and 
country by country across Africa, before applying 
these results to a high-level stress test. The final 
outputs are estimates of changes in expected 

losses from lending and changes in equity prices, 
aggregated into the portfolios of several leading 
African commercial financial institutions. It also 
estimates these changes for the national aggregate 
lending portfolios of six African countries.

The case for action

If current trends continue, Africa may breach 
environmental tipping points causing large-
scale physical risks for financial assets. The 
transgression of tipping points, such as the 
complete loss of pollinators or dieback of coral 
reefs, would create severe costs for businesses and 
is becoming more likely, both globally and in Africa. 
For example, research suggests the loss of 20 to 
30 percent of remaining forest cover in the Amazon 
rainforest would trigger an irreversible conversion 
of all remaining forest to savannah. Equivalent 
figures are not yet available for the Congo Basin, 
though studies have confirmed that projected future 
deforestation in Western and Central Africa is likely 
to disrupt the West African monsoon, dramatically 
affecting rain-fed agriculture, in particular maize 
crops north of the equator. twenty-five percent of 
African countries, including South Africa and most 
of Northern Africa, are already water stressed today. 
Acute tail risk events like these have the potential to 
make business practices that are highly dependent 
on nature infeasible and strand assets in affected 
areas. Examples include rain-fed agriculture, 
pharmaceutical research, and ecotourism.

The modelling framework does not capture 
these tipping points and underestimates nature-
related physical risks. Across all the portfolios 
considered, the changes in asset value driven by 
physical risk exposure are limited. However, they 
are underestimates for four reasons. First, current 
frameworks model risks from incremental changes 
in ecosystems, and do not model the large-scale 
tail risks associated with crossing environmental 
tipping points. Second, the assessment considers 
average risk at the country level, masking a broad 
distribution of impacts across sub-national locations 
and companies. Risks for some individual locations 
and companies will be substantially higher than the 
average. Third, the assessment evaluates a subset 

6

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksof physical risks considered to be the most material 
and feasible to model (see Appendix 1). There are 
also physical risks that are not modelled such as 
the loss of natural water filtration or flood and storm 
protection, and these could be material. Fourth, 
similar to climate change, the physical risks of 
nature loss will intensify over time, with more severe 
impacts beyond 2050, the time horizon considered 
in this analysis.

Mounting physical risks make global consumer 
and policy action to address the nature crisis 
more likely. The fast pace at which nature 
is degrading and the severe consequence of 
environmental tipping points have led many 
researchers to proclaim a state of nature crisis.  
Policymakers and regulators around the world 
are already acting to address nature loss and 
are cooperating to facilitate a ‘net-zero and 
nature-positive’ transition – a transition that not 
which ensures a future state of nature (including 
biodiversity, ecosystem services, and natural 
capital) that not which is greater than the current 
state. For example, in 2021, summit statements from 
leaders of the G7, G20, and COP26 committed to a 
‘net-zero and nature-positive transition’. 

Asset value results

Ambitious consumer and policy actions taken 
to halt net nature degradation will substantially 
impact the financial institution portfolios 
considered, with changes in the value of equity 
portfolios ranging from +2 to -5 percent by 
2030 and of loan books ranging from +0.3 to 
-0.6 percent. These changes are large given the 
limited exposure to nature-intensive sectors such 
as agriculture and extractives across the portfolios. 
As mentioned above, they also reflect average 
impacts. Individual subsectors, locations, and 
companies can experience much larger impacts. 
Gains are driven by exposure to high-growth 
agricultural commodities that not which benefit from 
the expansion of alternative proteins (for example, 
sugarcane and pulses) which have lower impacts 
on nature than traditional proteins. Losses are 
driven by exposure to slower-growth agricultural 
commodities linked to pastoral farming (for example, 

corn and tropical roots), exposure to deforestation-
linked minerals, and to a lesser extent, exposure to 
related downstream sectors, such as manufacturing, 
wholesale trade, and retail trade. Losses can 
be offset by diversifying portfolios to include 
companies with less nature-intensive practices 
and by focusing on areas of opportunity that may 
emerge in a nature-positive scenario.

Looking specifically at the agriculture and 
extractives sectors, expected gains and losses 
by 2030 are an order of magnitude higher, 
representing material shifts in value that require 
immediate attention. For equity, changes in value 
are significant, reaching between -2 percent and 
-5 percent for agriculture in most countries, and 
between +1 percent and -4 percent for extractives. 
In the most extreme examples, the value of 
agricultural investments increases by +55 percent 
in one country and falls by -22 percent in another. 
For lending, changes in loan book value can also 
be large, reaching between +5 percent and -3 
percent for agriculture, and +0 to -3 percent for 
extractives. Again, these results are averages for a 
country-sector combination. The impacts for some 
individual subsectors, locations, and companies are 
significantly higher.

For the most exposed lending portfolios, nature-
related risks in agriculture and extractives would 
roughly double expected losses due to credit risk 
by 2030. Based on our experience in working with 
the financial sector, diversified private banks would 
typically expect losses from traditional credit risks 
(unrelated to climate or nature) of around 3 to 5 
percent over a ten-year period. This is roughly in 
line with the highest estimated losses from lending 
to agriculture and extractives as a result of nature-
related risks, presented above. This represents a 
substantial decrease in the profitability of lending 
to these sectors unless these risks are carefully 
managed, for example, through stewardship.

Nature-related risks in agriculture and 
extractives are of the same (large) scale 
as climate-related risks in manufacturing, 
chemicals, and extractives. Equity values closely 
track changes in the expected future flow of profits. 

7

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksBased on our nature-related risk assessment, 
profits in agriculture and deforestation-linked 
extractives will likely fall by 20 percent and 15 
percent respectively in 2050 under our most 
ambitious scenario. By contrast, climate-related 
risk assessment work by Vivid Economics and 
Planetrics has shown that in a 2050 net-zero 
scenario, manufacturing, chemicals, and extractives 
would see profit losses in 2050 of roughly 10 
percent, 15 percent, and 25 percent respectively. 
For both nature and climate, this is primarily driven 
by transition risk.

Risks and opportunities driving asset 
value

If current trends continue, water stress across 
Africa would make agricultural production in 
the worst affected areas significantly more 
expensive by 2030. As already high levels of water 
stress worsen in the future, countries that face 
the highest pressure on limited water resources 
may consider methods to manage access to water. 
For agricultural businesses, this could increase 
the unit production costs of several agricultural 
commodities by +20 to +40 percent in 2030, 
relative to a baseline scenario which does not 
account for these risks. Without mitigating action, 
this would create large knock-on increases in 
commodity prices, often between +15 and +30 
percent, affecting both downstream businesses  
and consumers.

Projected changes in land use between now and 
2030 would affect the population of species 
that attract tourists in Africa and hence the 
financial performance of ecotourism. In this 
respect, Eastern and Southern African countries are 
at highest risk, as they account for a large share of 
tourism activity and are projected to see the fastest 
rates of change in land use. As mentioned above, if 
environmental tipping points linked to tourism are 
reached, such as the dieback of coral reefs in South-
eastern Africa, impacts on demand and profits 
would be severe.

The need to mitigate these physical risks and 
preserve space for nature would require supply-

side adjustments in land-intensive industries, 
often increasing production costs. Areas that 
are afforested, reforested, or become protected 
would no longer be available for agriculture. As a 
result, farmers would intensify yields to meet rising 
food demand. The investment in intensification 
would increase unit production costs in 2030, 
often by +5 to +20 percent relative to a baseline 
scenario. Over time, yield improvements would 
bring unit costs down, resulting in lower-than-
baseline costs by 2050. The highest levels of 
intensification would occur in Central and Eastern 
Africa, where deforestation pressures and 
biodiversity value are high. In extractives, if export 
markets introduce deforestation standards such 
as those under consideration in the European 
Union (EU), deforestation associated with gold 
and copper could become a market access risk. 
In addition, regulators may require businesses to 
restore affected land. Although the additional costs 
might be small through 2030, they could reach -2 
to -33 percent of baseline unit production costs by 
2050. In the food sector, in which local demand is 
predominantly met by local supply, consumers will 
bear the rising cost of production, leaving profit 
margins in the food business largely unchanged. For 
minerals, the incidence of cost pass-through may be 
lower, leaving producers and asset owners to bear a 
greater share of rising costs.

Shifts in food demand can reduce the nature 
impact of the food system and make room for 
the nature-positive transition. Based on existing 
literature, discouraging diet shifts towards meat 
and dairy and reducing food waste would be key 
levers to significantly reduce the future nature- and 
climate-impacts of the African food system. This 
would decelerate growth in food demand, primarily 
driven by population and income growth, and 
relieve pressure on the food system. Staple grains 
used for livestock feed would be most affected, 
with compound annual growth rates in demand 
falling substantially under the most ambitious 
scenarios from +3 percent to +1 percent. By 
contrast, alternative proteins would offer growth 
opportunities for agribusinesses. With ambitious 
action, aggregate profits in 2050 from relevant 
crops – such as pulses and sugar crops – would

Looking at agriculture as a whole, aggregate profits 
would not grow as fast as they do in the baseline 
scenario, with profits -1 to -3 percent below baseline 
in 2030, and -10 to -23 percent below baseline 
in 2050. Put differently, aggregate profits would 
increase by +365 percent between 2020 and 2050 
in our most ambitious scenario, compared to +470 
percent in the baseline. This difference primarily 
reflects moderated increases in demand rather than 
reduced profit margins. This demonstrates that 
growth prospects would still be strong and robust 
in Africa, even with ambitious action to reduce and 
reverse net nature loss across the continent.

Practical management of nature-
related opportunities and risks

Financial regulators and supervisors are 
moving towards bringing nature-related risks 
into the scope of financial regulation. In March 
2022, the Network for Greening the Financial 
System (NGFS), representing 114 central banks 
and financial supervisors, concluded ‘that nature-
related financial risks should be considered by 
central banks and supervisors for the fulfilment of 
their mandates’. In the same month, the Taskforce 
on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) 
released its beta framework, laying the foundation 
for how businesses across the world – including the 
financial sector – might be expected to manage and 
disclose their actions on nature.

• 

• 

• 

For African financial institutions, this presents 
several challenges given current capacity, 
processes, and guidance:

• 

• 

  Limited capacity: Eighty percent of the 
institutions we engaged with are building out 
their climate risk capabilities and have not 
allocated capacity to take on nature. It is not 
yet clear how to effectively integrate nature 
with climate thereby minimising the internal 
resources required to act on nature. 

  Lending to sectors with indirect exposure: 
The portfolios we examined had significant 
exposure to sectors with indirect and 
complex exposure to nature-related risks and 

opportunities, such as financial services (up to 
20 percent in some cases) and tourism-related 
industries (up to 7 percent). The ways in which 
these sectors impact or depend on nature are 
not yet well understood.

  Counterparty data availability: The data 
required for assessments are not routinely 
collected from counterparties. For example, 
none of the institutions we examined collected 
data on the location of physical assets in a 
standardised way across industries. Financial 
institutions cannot close this data gap by 
purchasing third-party data, as datasets do 
not yet comprehensively cover non-listed 
businesses. As a result, institutions can only 
perform a coarser sector-level assessment. 
It is also challenging for financial institutions 
to understand and assess complex tail risks 
associated with highly localised tipping points.

  Attracting skills and talent: Financial 
institutions reported difficulty in recruiting 
staff with the right skills and experience for 
nature-related oversight. Requirements include 
proficiency with spatial data, understanding 
of scientific physical processes, and the ability 
to work across several departments including 
sustainability, financial risk, and compliance.

  Regulatory expectations and support: 
Financial institutions indicated that it would be 
easier to secure internal investment to develop 
nature-related oversight capacity if there are 
clear signals that such oversight will become 
a regulatory requirement. Regulators have not 
yet set a timeline for when they may implement 
the recommendations of the NGFS on nature-
related risks.

Options for action

In preparing to address nature-related risks 
and comply with any future regulation, financial 
institutions can:

• 

  Consider climate and nature together from 
the start. Build integrated climate- and nature-
related risk assessment and management 

9

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksFinancial regulators, framework issuers, 
policy-makers, and data providers can play a 
pivotal role. Regulators can clearly communicate 
their plans to integrate climate and nature risk 
management and a timeline for implementing 
the NGFS recommendations on nature-related 
risk. They can work together to provide guidance 
to the private sector, including how to deal with 
issues specific to African financial systems, such 
as working with currently available data. They can 
examine how this would change micro-prudential 
supervision frameworks such as supervisory review 
processes, disclosure templates, and minimum 
capital requirements. Framework issuers and 
standard setters – including but not limited to the 
TNFD – can follow structured piloting processes 
covering each of the most important sectors and 
asset classes in Africa. In a similar way to regulators, 
policymakers can outline in advance the future 
direction of policy to protect and restore Africa’s 
natural capital, in order to help financial institutions 
anticipate medium- and longer-term risks. Finally, 
data providers can engage with financial institutions 
and leverage new AI-driven technologies to solve 
data gaps, such as access to data on private    
(non-listed) companies.

• 

• 

• 

• 

   processes. Integration makes both 
approaches more robust (due to climate-
nature interactions), reduces overall cost, and 
alleviates capacity pressures.

  Engage with the TNFD and other key actors. 
Through engagement, financial institutions 
can infuse frameworks such as the TNFD’s 
framework with practical considerations for 
their application in Africa. Engagement can 
reflect each organisation’s own experience 
with nature-related risks and opportunities. 
High-priority topics raised in our working 
group focused on how to overcome the barriers 
discussed above, such as guidance on what 
data to collect and how to assess exposure for 
financial services and tourism.

   Link training and capacity with climate. To 
tackle difficulties in recruitment, organisations 
can build the skills of their current staff. Many 
of the same skills are required for climate- and 
nature-related oversight, so capacity can be 
built for both within the same team.

   Upgrade support systems. More data will 
be needed on the sectoral and geographical 
distribution of clients’ revenues, the location 
of clients’ operations, the state of local 
ecosystems on which they depend, and the 
actions being taken to address the clients’ 
impacts and dependencies on nature and its 
services. Many of the data needed for climate 
assessments are also needed for nature, and so 
data collection strategies can address  
both simultaneously.

   Support customers. Customers and investees 
will need support to navigate the net-zero 
carbon and nature-positive transition. This 
includes providing advice and expertise to 
support clients to understand and manage 
nature-related risks as well as access to capital 
for investment.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksIntroduction

13

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksThis report presents, for the first time, risk 
assessment and stress-testing frameworks 
that financial institutions can extend to the 
opportunities and risks relating to nature. The 
completed quantitative risk assessment proves 
that nature-related risk assessment for financial 
institutions is feasible. It shows materiality in a 
region with high growth opportunities and globally 
important natural capital. And in a world-first for 
Africa, it offers an example of what is feasible in 
Africa – and thus of what is feasible across much of 
the world. 

In showing how the TNFD framework for 
assessing and managing nature-related risks 
and opportunities can be applied in Africa, the 
report:

• 

• 

• 

  applies the Locate, Evaluate, and Assess 
stages of the TNFD beta framework’s LEAP 
process in practice (see Section 3 for a more 
detailed discussion of how this study maps to 
the LEAP approach).

  estimates the exposure key African economic 
sectors to nature-related opportunities and 
risks.

  completes first-of-their-kind stress tests for a 
selection of commercial financial institutions 
and financial systems in Africa, covering both 
corporate lending and equity.

The remainder of this report is structured as 
follows:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

  Section 2 covers the materiality of nature for 
Africa’s financial sector.

  Section 3 quantifies some of the connections 
between nature and the value of the lending 
portfolios of commercial financial institutions 
and nations.

  Section 4 lays out evidence of the links 
between nature and non-financial corporate 
performance.

  Section 5 explores some of the potential 
obstacles that African financial institutions 
might face when implementing the TNFD.

  Section 6 identifies options for unlocking 
financial risk management in relation to nature 
in Africa.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksBackground

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksThe state of nature in Africa 

The African economy relies upon the planet’s 
natural systems. Twenty-three percent of African 
GDP is highly dependent on nature, as is the 
stability of the financial systems within Africa – and 
thus opportunities for economic growth and well-
being.¹ Yet, nature systems are currently in a state 
of crisis, with nature degrading at rates faster than 
humanity has previously experienced.² As we have 
seen with climate change, exposed businesses 
that adapt to changes, mitigate adverse impacts, 
and build resilience enjoy significant opportunities 
and competitive advantage. They face risks as well. 
Nature loss is equally urgent – perhaps even more 
urgent – than climate change for African citizens; in 
Africa, the immediate need is to avoid environmental 
tipping points such as local ecosystem collapse. The 
physical hazards associated with the collapse of 
local ecosystems, for example, stark reduction of 
rainfall due to rainforest die back or desertification 
of farmland, and the resulting impacts on the 
livelihood of African citizens could be severe.

Yet Africa’s natural capital is declining at a high 
rate, exceeding global trends. For example, 
between 2001 and 2020, several African countries 
lost up to 30 percent of their tree cover, compared 
to 11 percent globally.³ African biodiversity has 
declined on average by 4.2 percent, considerably 
higher than the global average of 2.7 percent.⁴ 
twenty-five percent of African countries are already 
considered water stressed today and acute water 
shortages such as South Africa’s 2018 water crisis 
are becoming more likely.⁵ The production of some 
of Africa’s top export commodities – such as copper 
and fruits – contribute to this nature loss.

Global action on nature

Policy-makers and regulators around the world 
are already acting to address nature loss and are 

cooperating to facilitate a ‘net-zero and nature-
positive’ transition. In 2021, summit statements 
from leaders of the G7, G20, and COP26 committed 
to a ‘net-zero and nature-positive transition’. At the 
United Nations’ COP26 climate-change conference, 
45 governments pledged to protect nature through 
wide-ranging reforms in agriculture, food systems, 
and marine industries.⁶ Central banks in France and 
the Netherlands published innovative nature stress 
tests.⁷’⁸ In March 2022, the Network for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS), representing 114 
central banks and financial supervisors, concluded 
that ‘nature-related financial risks should be 
considered by central banks and supervisors 
for the fulfilment of their mandates’.⁹ Later this 
year, China will host the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD) COP15 conference, at which global 
leaders may adopt a Post-2020 Global Biodiversity 
Framework (GBF). Over the last two years, the UK 
has introduced legally binding targets to halt the 
decline in national wildlife populations by 2030 
and increase species populations by 10 percent by 
2042.¹⁰ Perhaps the GBF will be a turning point for 
global action on nature, as the Paris Agreement was 
for climate.

The private sector has also begun to commit 
to action. Under the Finance for Biodiversity 
Pledge, 84 financial institutions, managing €12.6 
trillion in assets, have committed to set targets for 
their impacts on nature, and to disclose progress 
towards them. Financial institutions are developing 
nature-positive investment strategies and 
products; early movers in Europe include HSBC 
Global Asset Management, Lombard Odier, and 
Mirova. At COP26, 100 British-affiliated companies 
committed to becoming ‘nature-positive’, joining 
global giants such as GSK and Holcim. More than 
1,000 companies with combined revenues of around 
US $5 trillion signed Business for Nature’s Call to 
Action, demanding that ‘governments adopt policies 
now to reverse nature loss this decade’.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksLink to TNFD beta framework

The assessment maps to the LEAP approach in 
the following way:

Against this backdrop, the Taskforce on Nature-
related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) released 
its beta framework in March 2022, thus laying 
the foundation for businesses to disclose their 
exposure to and actions on nature.¹¹ Following 
in the footsteps of the TCFD, which set the global 
standard for climate disclosures, the TNFD 
framework is expected to be the predominant, 
globally coordinating framework for businesses 
to report and act on nature-related risks and 
opportunities.¹² After its full launch in 2023, the 
framework is expected to be integrated into 
sustainability reporting standards – such as the 
standards developed by the new IFRS International 
Sustainability Standards Board – and hence into 
mandatory reporting regulations around the world.¹³ 
It is intended to be acted upon alongside the TCFD, 
with the framework aligned with the four pillars of 
the TCFD framework: governance, strategy, risk 
management, and metrics and targets.

The study demonstrates that the TNFD’s LEAP 
(Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) approach 
of the TNFD beta framework can be applied to 
financial portfolios in Africa to quantify nature-
related risks.¹⁴ Globally, this report is the first to 
present the results of applying the Locate, Evaluate 
and Assess stages of the LEAP approach to a 
private financial institution’s portfolio and to a 
national financial system. Moreover, the assessment 
focuses on Africa, demonstrating feasibility even 
when less data is available.

  Locate interface with nature: The approach 
accounts for country-specific drivers of both 
physical and transition opportunities and risks. 
It accounts for the integrity of ecosystems 
at the national level including through the 
Biodiversity Intactness Index, remaining 
forest cover, and air and water pollutant 
concentrations. It also accounts for the 
likelihood of nature-related policy or regulation 
across different sector-geographies.

  Evaluate dependencies and impacts:  
The approach takes a focus on the agriculture 
and extractives sectors, identifying their most 
important dependencies and impacts on 
nature, and quantifying their size and scale 
relative to production. It also considers how 
these dependencies and impacts are likely to 
impact downstream sectors that source inputs 
from nature-intensive primary sectors through 
changes in the price of primary commodities.  

  Assess material risks and opportunities: 
The approach uses forward-looking scenario 
analysis with a focus on 2030 and 2050 
to estimate the risks and opportunities 
corresponding to these dependencies and 
impacts, assuming current risk management 
approaches continue in the future. In doing so, 
it identifies which risks and opportunities are 
material.

  Prepare to respond and report: In Section 6, 
the report discusses how financial institutions 
in Africa may wish to adjust their strategies 
in order to respond to these opportunities 
and risks. The Prepare section of the LEAP 
framework will be bespoke to each individual 
organisation and is not presented here.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
Comparison to existing assessments of 
nature-related risks and opportunities

Over the past few years, several landmark 
studies have helped us understand how to assess 
nature-related risks and opportunities, as well 
as the impacts and dependencies that underpin 
them. The academic, development-finance, NGO 
(non-governmental organisation), and regulatory 
communities have assessed nature-related risks 
across financial systems in France, the Netherlands, 
Brazil,¹⁵ Malaysia,¹⁶ and the global asset base of DFIs 
(development financial institutions).¹⁷’¹⁸’¹⁹ Guidance 
is also emerging on the use of tools and data to 
assess risks and opportunities.²⁰’²¹ The authors are 
early movers in the space and there is yet to be an 
assessment focused on Africa.

This study is the first of its kind to estimate 
the impact of nature-related risks on financial 
institutions and financial systems in terms of 
changes to expected loan book value and equity 
value. It builds on the pioneering nature-related 
stress tests undertaken by Banque de France and 
De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), which estimated 
the share of assets held in the French and Dutch 
financial systems considered at high risk from 
nature loss.²²’²³ For the first time, the analysis 
extends this approach to quantify changes in value 
of financial assets under scenarios of future action 
on climate and nature. For lending portfolios, it 
calculates changes in expected losses given default, 
accumulated over time. For equity portfolios, the 
analysis reports changes in market value.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksIntroduction to nature scenarios

The analysis employs five scenarios of future 
action on climate and nature, taking an approach 
that not which is typical for systemic and 
financial institution stress testing. The scenarios 
track a series of plausible narratives and states of 

the world. Unlike climate change, nature loss has 
not resulted in an internationally agreed global goal 
nor a set of national policy instruments to direct 
the transition. A scenario-based approach to risk 
assessment is an appropriate response to this policy 
uncertainty; see Appendix 1 for a discussion of the 
scenarios.

Continuation of current nature policies and

ambition for both nature and climate.

Any nature co-benefits from climate action 
are largely ineffective at halting the overall 
decline in nature. Accelerating nature loss 
continues, but at a slightly reduced pace. 

Effective area-based conservation improves 
nature integrity in key hotspots by 2030, but 
significant decline continues in other areas of 
the world. 

Trends of nature loss continue to accelerate 
to 2030 and then decelerate, leading to 
eventual reversal (i.e., positive nature trend) 
by 2050. 

Rapid transformation to halt and reverse 
nature loss by 2030 with significant 
biodiversity gains achieved by 2050. 

The scenarios become more ambitious over 
time, progressively layering on additional action 
on climate and nature. The business-as-usual 
scenario, ‘Current Policies’, assumes that current 
trends in climate change and nature loss continue. 
The ‘Climate Only’ scenario is consistent with global 
warming of 1.5 degrees celsius and considers the 
cessation of deforestation, extensive bioenergy 
production, and moderate shifts in diets and food 
waste as levers to reduce global climate impacts 
(without consideration of nature impacts). The 
‘Climate + Protection’ scenario adds ambitious 

expansion of protected nature areas, thereby 
improving nature outcomes. The two nature 
scenarios, ‘Climate + Nature’, include a broader set 
of measures that tackle pollution, reduce bioenergy 
use, and show more dramatic shifts in diets and 
food waste habits, specifically to reduce global 
nature impacts. These two scenarios halt and 
reverse nature loss but differ in timing. The baseline 
scenario serves as a comparator in which physical 
and transition risks are not accounted for. Exhibit 1 
briefly describes the scenarios, while the details are 
laid out in Appendix 1.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksPortfolio composition

The TNFD framework is applied to a synthetic 
equity portfolio, three private banks in Africa, 
and the national lending portfolios of six African 
countries. The synthetic equity portfolio²⁴ is spread 
across five countries of focus; the three private 
banks are headquartered in different countries; and, 
the national lending portfolios are in Egypt, Kenya, 
Ghana, Mauritius, South Africa, and Zambia.

The portfolios have exposure across a range of 
African countries with a regional spread across 
the continent. This geographical variety affects 
factors such as the crop mix of the agriculture sector, 
exposure to deforestation pressure, the likelihood 
that protected areas will be expanded, and the 
mineral mix of the extractives sector. Different 
countries will also vary in the pace and ambition of 

policy action under a given scenario. For the three 
private banks, lending is diversified across several 
countries, but with the majority of assets held in a 
single country.

The level of exposure to agriculture and 
extractives ranges considerably across the 
portfolios, from 2 percent to 20 percent of total 
portfolio value. Exposure to agriculture ranges 
from 2 percent to 14 percent of total portfolio 
value, while exposure to extractives (mining and 
quarrying) ranges from 0 percent to 9 percent. 
Exhibit 2 below shows the sectoral composition of 
the financial portfolios.²⁵ There is greater exposure 
to downstream sectors that use agricultural or 
extractive commodities as inputs. In particular, 
exposure to manufacturing ranges from 6 percent 
to 54 percent, and exposure to wholesale and retail 
trade ranges from 7 percent to 42 percent.

24  The data collected on private sector equity investments through the engagement process had negligible exposure to the agriculture and  
      extractives sectors;the focus of our assessment framework. For this reason, we chose to construct a synthetic equity portfolio that reflected  
      the structure of several African national economies.
25  As the scope of the risk assessment is to consider opportunities and risks to financial assets linked to corporate activity in Africa, we exclude
      assets linked to counterparties outside of Africa, as well as personal lending.

Aggregate impact on equity portfolio

Predicted changes in value to the equity portfolio 
are significant, with country-specific segments 
experiencing shifts in value between -5 and +2 
percent by 2030, rising to roughly -8 and +2 
percent by 2050, under the Climate + Nature 
Now scenario. ²⁶ Changes in equity values are 
calculated as the present discounted value of 
changes in the underlying companies’ expected 
profits. As a result, the estimated impacts of nature-
related opportunities and risks on companies’ 
profits are of a similar or larger magnitude than 
the impacts on equity value. Section 4 discusses 
changes to expected firm profits in detail. As shown 
in Exhibit 3, the market values of the country-
specific segments follow different trends overtime. 
The variance in financial impacts is mainly driven by 
two factors:

•  Direct exposure to the agriculture and 
extractives sectors. The scope of the 
analysis encompasses risks to agriculture 
and extractives as primary sectors, as well 
as to their downstream secondary sectors 
through price increases. Portfolios with greater 
exposure to these sectors exhibit higher 

estimated changes in equity value linked to 
agriculture and extractive producers, and to 
a lesser extent manufacturers of food and 
beverage products and electrical components.

•  Geographical exposure. The geographical 

exposure influences the expected change in 
equity value in several ways. For agriculture, 
the equity values are sensitive to the crop 
mix. Some commodities experience more 
rapid profit growth under ambitious action, 
such as those associated with alternative 
proteins. Others experience slower growth 
such as those associated with livestock feed. 
Similarly, equity values linked to the extractives 
sector are sensitive to whether the country 
in question produces minerals closely linked 
with deforestation. In addition to sectoral 
composition, many risk drivers are location-
specific, such as water availability and land-use 
regulation. For example, holding investments 
in cotton producers located in one place might 
be associated with higher nature-related risks 
relative to another. Financial institutions face 
higher expected changes in equity value if 
they hold stakes in producers which operate, 
for example, in water-stressed locations or 
deforestation hotspots.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksAggregate impact on lending portfolios

Aggregate impacts for lending vary significantly 
across portfolios with a spread of cumulative 
gains and losses from +0.3 to -0.6 percent 
by 2030, under the most ambitious scenario, 
Climate + Nature Now. This demonstrates that 
nature-related opportunities and risks could be 
of sufficient magnitude to affect the probability 
that companies are unable to service their debts 
and default. This changes the total amount of 
losses expected from lending in a given period. 
Cumulatively, over the next ten years, increases 
in gains or losses could reach as high as +0.3 and 
-0.6 percent of loan book value respectively. As 
explained above, the variation of impacts across 

portfolios is driven by their geographical and 
sectoral composition. By 2050, so over 30 years, 
cumulative gains and losses could reach +1.1 and 
-2.8 percent respectively, as illustrated in Exhibit 4.²⁷

Impacts are generally lower for lending relative 
to equity as the relationship between profits 
and expected losses is not linear. Expected 
losses remain minor until changes in company-
level profits cross a certain threshold at which 
point the company is unable to repay its loans. This 
threshold depends on the balance sheet strength 
and the credit rating of the company in question. 
The rationale is simple: companies’ earnings and 
assets will be used to repay loans first before paying 
dividends to equity owners.

27  As an example, imagine a bank’s loan portfolio is worth US $ 1 million in 2020 and background losses (for reasons other than nature) are 
     expected at 0.3 percent per year. Before accounting for nature, cumulative background losses by 2030 would reach 2.9 percent, leaving a  
     total loan book .

23

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksUnder less nature-ambitious scenarios, negative 
financial impacts on lending portfolios could be 
lower, but ubiquitous. For instance, cumulative 
expected losses reach a maximum of -0.4 percent 
by 2030 under the Climate + Protection scenario, 
compared to -0.6 percent under the Climate + 
Nature Now scenario. Moreover, under the Climate 
+ Protection scenario, impacts are all negative. 
Please see Exhibit 5. This suggests that a significant 
portion of nature-related risks are driven by 
interventions needed to address the climate crisis; 
and, second, action to address the nature crisis will 
bring significant, beneficial opportunities to some 

financial institutions. The results primarily reflect 
two differences between the scenarios. First, food 
demand grows more slowly under Climate + Nature 
Now due to changes in meat consumption and food 
waste habits. This slows growth in production of a 
range of commodities, which alleviates land-use 
competition and at the same time slows down the 
growth of sales. Second, costs associated with 
deforestation and protected areas are higher under 
Climate + Nature Now. A more detailed discussion 
of the differences in results among the scenarios 
follows Section 4.

  Value of US $ 971,000. If we then account for nature-related opportunities and risks for the Mauritian financial system, these 
losses could be offset by 0.3 percent gains reducing total cumulative losses to 2.6 percent and increasing total loan book 
value to US $ 974,000. For the Zambian financial system, these losses would increase by 0.6 percent to a cumulative total of 
3.5 percent decreasing total loan book value to US $ 965,000.

24

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksIn aggregate, the impacts on whole lending 
portfolios are material but relatively small, 
reflecting the limited exposure to the sectors 
modelled in the analysis across portfolios. 
As demonstrated in Exhibit 2, agriculture and 
extractives, where risk exposure is highest, make 
up only a small share of the portfolios, whereas for 
most assets within the portfolios, risk exposure is 
small. As a result, aggregate impacts across the 
entire portfolio appear small, while the impacts on 
agriculture and extractives specifically are material. 
The assessment does consider some but not all risk 
channels associated with downstream sectors such 
as manufacturing and trade, which make up much 
larger shares of the portfolios considered (see the 
later discussion at the end of this section). Nature-
related opportunities and risks for these sectors will 
be considerably higher than the results  
presented here.

Impacts on equity and lending 
portfolios by sector

For loans or investments in exposed sectors, the 
impacts are proportionately larger; expected 
losses reach a maximum of 3.2 percent and 2.6 
percent of total loan book value for agriculture 
and extractives, respectively, by 2030 under 
Climate + Nature Now. In other words, for country-
specific equity portfolios, negative impacts 
extend to -22 percent and -7 percent in 2030 for 
agriculture and extractives respectively. Also, if a 
financial institution considers only its loans to the 
agriculture sector, it could expect losses on those 
loans from nature-related risks to reach a maximum 
of -3.2 percent of their initial value by 2030. Below 
these maximum values, there is significant variation 
across portfolios.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
 
For the most exposed lending portfolios, nature-
related risks in agriculture and extractives would 
roughly double expected losses due to credit risk 
by 2030. Based on our experience with working 
with the financial sector, diversified private banks 
would typically expect losses from traditional credit 
risks (unrelated to climate or nature) of around 3 to 
5 percent over a ten-year period. This is roughly in 
line with the highest estimated losses from lending 
to agriculture and extractives as a result of nature-
related risks, presented above. Exhibit 6 compares 
traditional credit risks to the gains and losses seen 
across the case study portfolios from lending to 
agriculture. For the most affected portfolios, this 
represents a substantial increase or decrease in the 
profitability of lending to these sectors.

Nature-related risks in agriculture and extraction 
of deforestation-linked minerals are of the same 
scale as climate-related risks in manufacturing, 
chemicals, and extractives. Both equity values 

changes and the expected performance of a loan 
is ultimately driven by companies’ profits. Thus, to 
compare the relevance of nature- and climate-
related risks, Exhibit 7 provides a comparison of 
their impact on companies’ profits in highly exposed 
sectors – namely, agriculture and extractives 
in Africa for nature-related risks as well as 
manufacturing, chemicals, and extractives globally 
for climate-related risks. Profits in agriculture might 
be lower than baseline by -20 percent in 2050 
under the strongest transition scenario, and by 
-15 percent for extraction of deforestation-linked 
minerals. A comparison to climate-related risk 
assessment work reveals that these impacts roughly 
align with typical climate-related risk exposure in 
net-zero scenarios for highly exposed sectors such 
as manufacturing, chemicals, and extractives, which 
see profits in 2050 lower by of roughly -10 percent, 
-15 percent, and -25 percent respectively.²⁸ Climate-
related risks for the most exposed sectors are much 
higher; for example, oil and gas experiences profit 
losses of roughly -70 percent by 2050.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksAgriculture sector deep dive

Gains and losses in 2030 on equity investments 
in agriculture are again much larger, ranging from 
+55 percent to -22 percent across countries. 
Two factors determine the contribution of the 
agriculture sector to aggregate portfolio losses: 
the expected change in equity value linked to 
agriculture producers and the relative exposure to 
agriculture within each portfolio; see Exhibit 8. For 
example, consider the equity portfolio mirroring 
the Mauritian economy. In Mauritius, where profits 
of sugar cane producers are predicted to grow by 
roughly 60 percent under Climate + Nature Now, 
the value of investments in agricultural businesses 
could increase by more than 50 percent). ²⁹ Despite 
the size of this increase, the aggregate value of 
the Mauritian portfolio only increases by 2 percent 
(Exhibit 2) in 2030, as agriculture accounts for only 4 
percent of the portfolio.

Agricultural commodities can be classified 
into three categories based on their financial 
impacts: high growth, minor impacts, and slow 
growth. First, high-growth commodities such as 
sugar cane and alternative proteins experience 
financial gains from ambitious actions to reverse 
nature loss due to diet shifts. For example, sugar 
cane in Mauritius sees an increase in equity value of 
roughly +55 percent by 2030. Second, commodities 
such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables experience 
minor impacts due to moderate cost increases 
and slower growth in demand due to reduced food 
waste. For example, the equity value of fruits, nuts, 
and vegetables producers in Kenya decreases by -5 
percent by 2030. Third, commodities such as corn 
and tropical roots are used as livestock feed and 
see significantly slower growth due to changes in 
meat and dairy consumption.³⁰ For example, equity 
investments in corn producers in South Africa could 
see a decline in value by -33 percent by 2030.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
The variation in impacts for lending to agriculture 
is largely driven by the national mix of crops 
across these three categories. Mauritius, for 
example, has a particularly high exposure to high-
growth commodities, with sugar cane representing 
90 percent of crop production. South Africa has 
a relatively mixed exposure, with fruits, nuts, and 
vegetables accounting for 56 percent of crop 
production, and the remainder relatively diversified. 
In Ghana, exposure to slow-growth commodities is 
relatively high, with tropical roots, corn, and cereals 
accounting for 68 percent of crop production.

Cumulative changes in losses by 2030 on 
agricultural loans range from an improvement of 
+5.4 percent to a worsening of -3.2 percent and 
largely explain aggregate portfolio-level impacts. 
Analogous to the equity portfolios, the impact of 
the lending portfolio depends on the cumulative 
expected gain or loss from lending to agriculture 
and the relative exposure to agriculture within each 
portfolio; see Exhibit 9. The Zambian financial 
system has both the highest risk to agricultural

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksExtractives sector deep dive

Similarly, in 2030, the change in equity value 
for holding in the extractives sector range from 
+1.0 percent to -3.7 percent, and +0.1 percent 
to -2.6 percent for loans, with variation driven by 
exposure to different countries across Africa. Our 
modelling assesses risks to the extractives sector 
through its impact on deforestation, which within 
Africa is highly concentrated in gold and copper 
production. This is due to the fact that almost all 

deforestation linked to extractives within Africa 
is driven by gold and copper (see discussion of 
extractives in Section 4). The results presented in 
Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 11 reflect this. Impacts are 
substantial for portfolios with high exposure to 
countries that are key producers of gold and copper. 
For example, Ghana is a key producer of gold, which 
accounts for 41 percent of total mineral export value. 
Impacts on other portfolios are limited, as mining 
activities largely focus on other minerals.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
 
Downstream sectors deep dive

How to interpret the results

The impacts of price increases on downstream 
sectors are more muted, reaching a maximal 
decline of equity value of -0.1 percent in 2030 for 
wholesale and retail trade, and -1.4 percent for 
manufacturing. Impacts for the loan portfolio are 
also muted, with an expected loss of -0.7 percent 
and -0.4 percent for wholesale and retail trade and 
manufacturing, respectively. It is important to note 
that these results capture the impact of input price 
changes, but not demand changes. Put differently, 
the impact of diet shifts on the sales of meat 
producers is not reflected in these figures. Generally, 
impacts from input price changes are significantly 
smaller for downstream sectors than for primary 
sectors, as these commodities account for only a 
limited portion of downstream sectors’ production 
costs. Price changes can vary across commodities, 
depending on the change in production costs 
and the competitiveness of the market, which in 
turn determines the degree to which costs can be 
passed on to consumers. As a result, changes in 
crop mix can also affect the scale of impacts on 
downstream sectors. Finally, price changes are 
relevant for manufacturing and trade associated 
with food and electrical products. These subsectors 
vary in importance across different countries, and 
hence different portfolios.

However, if policies or regulations account 
for the full range of impacts on supply chains, 
downstream sectors will see risk exposure 
comparable to that of primary sectors. As 
mentioned above, we conservatively assume that 
policy and regulation will penalise companies 
based on the nature-related impacts of their 
own operations, and not of their value chains. If 
regulation were to include full value-chain impacts, 
as is suggested within the TNFD framework, then 
the risk exposure of downstream sectors that rely 
heavily on agricultural commodities or minerals 
would be similar to that of the primary sectors from 
which they purchase inputs.

We estimate risks for assets in the most 
nature-intensive sectors, namely agriculture 
and extractives, and further down the supply 
chain. Agriculture and extractives face three types 
of nature-related physical risks in this analysis; 
changes in: water availability, soil productivity, and 
pollination. They also face transition opportunities 
and risks in five categories: demand shifts, 
deforestation, protected areas, water pollution, 
and air pollution.³¹ For primary sectors, each of 
these categories affects a company’s profitability 
by changing its profit margin or the volume of 
goods it produces. Downstream sectors such as 
manufacturing, wholesale trade, and retail trade are 
affected by changes in the prices of commodities.

From a risk management perspective, these 
nature-related risks are additional to those 
arising from climate change. The nature-related 
channels of physical and transition risk are not 
typically accounted for in climate risk assessments. 
However, nature loss and climate change are 
linked, and financial institutions can address both 
in an integrated fashion. Please see Section 5 for a 
detailed discussion. 

To assess the impact of nature-related 
opportunities and risks on lending and equity 
portfolios, we deploy a micro-level model 
providing firm-level estimates of profit changes. 
As illustrated in Exhibit 12, we estimate the impacts 
on lending and equity portfolios in three steps. First, 
we assess how nature-related opportunities and 
risks will change production costs, how much of this 
cost change will be passed through to consumers, 
and how demand is likely to change in the future. 
Second, we evaluate how the cost and demand 
changes will impact firm-level profits. Third, we 
assess how the change in firm-level profits will 
change the book value of lending to that company, 
or the value of equity issues by that company. 
Appendix 1 provides a more detailed description of 
the methodology and how we determine the implied 
changes in production costs and demand.

31  The scope of the opportunity and risk assessment covers crop production within agriculture. For the case study analysis, we assume that the 
     agriculture sector overall experiences financial impacts that are similar to the impacts on crop production.

The effects of nature loss on company-level 
profits translates directly into changes in equity 
value; the effect on the performance of loans is 
more complex. For equity investments, changes 
in market value reflect changes in the discounted 
value of future profits. For lending, the effects alter 
credit ratings and, thereafter, the probability of 
default. The change in probability of default is used 
to model the change in loss given default. Together, 
these outputs determine annual expected losses 
given default, which accumulate over time.

This analysis spans a subset of material risk 
channels. There are several other risk channels 
not included in the scope that may also be material, 
particularly for downstream sectors. As a result, 
our estimates of risks and opportunities may be 
underestimates. For example, for downstream 
sectors, the scope includes only cost increases 
through primary commodity price changes; it does 
not account for risks and opportunities associated 
with direct operations or demand changes. Please 
see Appendix 1 for more detail.

If current trends continue, Africa may breach 
environmental tipping points causing large-
scale physical risks for financial assets. The 
transgression of tipping points, such as the 
complete loss of pollinators or dieback of coral 
reefs, would create severe costs for businesses and 
is becoming more likely, both globally and in Africa. 
For example, research suggests the loss of 20 to 
30 percent of remaining forest cover in the Amazon 
rainforest would trigger an irreversible conversion 
of all remaining forest to savannah.³² Equivalent 
figures are not yet available for the Congo Basin, 
though studies have confirmed that projected future 
deforestation in Western and Central Africa is likely 
to disrupt the West African monsoon, dramatically 
affecting rain-fed agriculture, in particular maize 
crops north of the equator.³³ Twenty-five percent of 
African countries, including South Africa and most of 
Northern Africa, are already waterstressed today.³⁴ 
Acute tail risk events like these have the potential to 
make business practices that are highly dependent 

on nature infeasible and strand assets in affected 
areas. Examples include rain-fed agriculture, 
pharmaceutical research, and ecotourism.

The modelling framework does not capture 
these tipping points and underestimates nature-
related physical risks. Across all the portfolios 
considered, the changes in asset value driven by 
physical risk exposure are limited. However, they 
are underestimates for four reasons. First, current 
frameworks model risks from incremental changes 
in ecosystems, and do not model the large-scale 
tail risks associated with crossing environmental 
tipping points. Second, the assessment considers 
average risk at the country level, masking a broad 
distribution of impacts across sub-national locations 
and companies. Risks for some individual locations 
and companies will be substantially higher than the 
average. Third, the assessment evaluates a subset 
of physical risks considered to be the most material 
and feasible to model (see Appendix 1). There are 
also physical risks that are not modelled such as 
the loss of natural water filtration or flood and storm 
protection, and these could be material. Fourth, 
similar to climate change, the physical risks of 
nature loss will intensify over time, with more severe 
impacts beyond 2050, the time horizon considered 
in this analysis.

If physical risks are underestimated, the negative 
financial impacts in less nature-ambitious 
scenarios might in reality be significantly higher. 
Recall that the value of the lending portfolios 
declined consistently under the Climate + Protection 
scenario, but less than the most impacted portfolio 
under the Climate + Nature Now scenario. Also 
recall that overall risks under the Current Policies 
scenario were limited. Physical risks are expected to 
be highest under Current Policies, moderate under 
Climate + Protection, and lowest under Climate + 
Nature Now. Thus, in a hypothetical assessment that 
not which accounts for all possible physical risks, 
the negative impacts under the Current Policies and 
Climate + Protection scenarios are likely to  
be higher.

have smaller impacts, albeit with localised effects 
on specific crops.

The importance of the agriculture, extractives, 
and tourism sectors, which are particularly 
exposed to nature-related risks and 
opportunities, to gross domestic product (GDP) 
varies considerably across different countries. 
Across the continent as a whole, the three sectors 
together accounted for roughly 30 percent of 
GDP in 2019. Agriculture, extractives, and tourism 
contributed 16.0, 5.8 and 6.9 percent respectively. 
The relative importance of these sectors varies 
across countries. In Kenya and Ghana, the three 
sectors together account for roughly 40 percent of 
GDP, yet only 16 percent in South Africa. In Mauritius, 
the agriculture and extractives sectors only account 
for 4 percent of GDP, while tourism represents 
almost 20 percent. The importance of agriculture 
in particular varies considerably, accounting for 
60 percent of GDP in Sierra Leone and less than 3 
percent in South Africa.³⁵

Current trends draw us closer to severe 
physical risks

Nature in Africa is degrading at rates that 
will disrupt businesses in the next ten years, 
particularly through declining water availability 
and habitat loss. The degradation of natural 
capital has direct consequences for the primary 
sectors that rely on it. First, among the drivers of risk 
included in this analysis, water stress has by far the 
largest economic impact due to agriculture’s strong 
dependency on water. Second, habitat degradation 
linked to forest loss and agricultural expansion 
could undermine the tourism industry, especially 
in parts of East and Southern Africa. The other 
physical risks considered – such as deteriorating 
soil quality and declining pollinator populations – 

Water stress is already a strategic priority for a 
quarter of Africa. Thirteen countries are already 
considered to be ‘water-stressed’ today, meaning 
that water demand exceeds 50 percent of water 
availability (see Exhibit 13). This condition will 
continue to worsen in the next ten years.³⁶ Northern 
Africa is most exposed, with levels of water stress 
comparable to much of Central and Southeast 
Asia. Acute episodes of shortage, such as South 
Africa’s 2018 water crisis, are likely to become 
more frequent and severe, leading to disruption. 
Although most of Central Africa is not considered to 
be waterstressed, due to the landscape’s retention 
capacity, land-use change could lead to sharp rises 
in water stress.

If water-stressed countries choose to impose 
regulations to address shortages, unit 
production costs in agriculture could increase by 
20 to 40 percent in 2030 for some crops. A wide 
range of sectors consume large amounts of water, 
including agriculture, extractives, heavy industry, 
chemicals, and utilities. Our work has focused on 
agriculture, where water stress could increase costs 
by requiring more irrigation or curtailing production. 
Costs could rise by 20 to 40 percent for staple 
crops – such as pulses and cereals – in Egypt, 
Morocco, and South Africa by 2050 in comparison 
to a baseline scenario in which water stress does 
not generate added costs. For some crops and 
countries, the effects of water stress can be severe; 
the cost of producing cereals, for example, could 
jump by an estimated 74 percent in Morocco, where 
wheat is a staple commodity already hit by droughts. 
The cost of water stress for Africa could reach 9 
percent in 2050 – more than five times the global 
average.

Ecotourism in Africa benefits from the 
abundance of animal species in tourist locations, 
making the tourism industry especially 
vulnerable to nature loss. Protected areas across 
14 African countries generate at least US $142 
million in entrance fees per year, but the revenue 
associated with tourism is much higher, as visitors 
spend on hospitality, accommodation, and transport 
as well.   Local communities and economies benefit 
from multiplier effects and the influx of foreign 
currencies. The richness of flagship species is an 
indicator of the richness of local species that attract 
tourists; these prized species include lions, leopards, 
rhinoceroses, elephants, and buffalo. There is a 
strong positive correlation between the number of 
visitors to national parks and the richness of flagship 
species, as indicated by the left-hand chart in 
Exhibit 14.

The potential for tourism revenue is highest in 
Southern and Eastern Africa. The map on the right 
panel of Exhibit 14 shows the tourism attractiveness 
of locations across Africa, as proxied by the 
estimated number of visitors to national parks in the 
area and influenced by species richness, national 
GDP, and distance to the closest city. The countries 
of Southern and Eastern Africa – South Africa, 
Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya – have the greatest 
potential.

Land-use decisions taken between now and 
2030 will affect the population of flagship 
species and future tourism revenues. 
Deforestation and agricultural expansion contribute 
to the destruction of flagship species’ habitats. If no 
action is taken to reverse current land-use trends, 
Africa’s ecotourism sector could face significant 
financial risks. The right panel in Exhibit 14 overlays 
future deforestation – indicated by coloured country 
boundaries – and tourism attractiveness. Eastern 
Africa’s tourism attractiveness index could drop 
lower than that of other regions due to a high risk of 
deforestation. Tourism revenues in South Africa are 
also threatened by habitat loss. 

Making space for nature involves 
supply-side adjustments

All effective responses to the climate and nature 
crises will involve the cessation of deforestation 
and the expansion of protected areas, among 
other actions. These steps are necessary 
because land use in Africa is a critical driver of 
nature loss and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. 
The left panel in Exhibit 15 shows estimates of 
future deforestation due to crop and pastureland 
expansion under current policies. Large areas of 
Central, Eastern, and Southern African forests could 
be lost. If these forests remain intact, however, that 
land could not be used for agriculture and hence 
contribute to the supply of food.

Deforestation and the absence of protected 
areas will increase crop production costs by 
about 10 percent in 2030 or, in more extreme 
scenarios,by up to 25 percent. To counter 
the incentive to expand the area of land under 
agriculture, new regulations might be introduced 
with charges for expansion, commitments to 
undertake restoration, or other measures. The 
costs of such measures would likely be especially 
significant in Central Africa, where competition 
for land would intensify if protected areas are 
expanded and deforestation is curbed. Commodities 
such as palm oil, coffee, and cocoa – which are 
closely linked to deforestation or are grown on land 
with high biodiversity value that could become 
protected – would be more exposed. For example, 
cotton companies operating in areas within the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that could 
become protected in the future, may need to adopt 
sustainable practices to comply with the new 
protected area regulations. This could increase 
unit production costs by 2 to 9 percent in 2030, 
across all policy scenarios. In Kenya, deforestation 
deterrents could raise unit production costs for 
cotton by 24 percent in 2030 in the Climate + 
Protection scenario.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksLimited land availability would cause 
intensification of agriculture production over 
the next decade and might increase production 
costs by 4 to 13 percent in 2030 in the most 
land-constrained scenarios. In order to intensify 
production, that is, increase yields per hectare, 
producers could increase the use of fertiliser inputs 
and invest in yield-enhancing machinery, and 
adopt better practices. The need for intensification 
is strongest in the Climate Only and Climate + 
Protection scenarios, where more land is needed for 
bioenergy production, and thus the food and energy 
system’s land footprint is largest. Production costs 
would rise by 4 to 13 percent in African agriculture 
overall in 2030 in the Climate Only and Climate + 
Protection scenarios, while costs would vary by 
country. For example, in 2030 cereal cultivation 
costs would rise by 9 to 12 percent in South Africa, 
which has more land constraints, whereas Angola 
has less pressure and would see increases of 6 to 
7 percent. The forestry sector might experience 
similar pressures and costs.

Intensified agricultural activity generates 
efficiencies in the long run. Though intensification 
involves initial investment that increases unit 
production costs up to 2030, it typically generates 
cost savings in the long term by improving 
productivity.³⁸ Taking the example of pulses in 
Kenya, a yield improvement of roughly 6 percent 
(in terms of tonnes of pulses per hectare) would 
reduce unit production costs by 1 percent. Yield 
improvements explain why cost changes associated 
with limits to agricultural landarea are generally 
larger (relative to the baseline) in 2030 than in 2050, 
as indicated in the right panel of Exhibit 15. In fact, 
intensification actions taken in the Climate Only and 
Climate + Protection scenarios for pulses in Kenya 
might bring costs down by 6 to 9 percent in 2050. 
In addition to improving the competitiveness of 
some agribusinesses, intensification also stimulates 
demand for the manufacture of inputs such as 
fertilisers, pesticides, machinery, and  
irrigation equipment.

38  Subsistence and small-scale farmers may be less able to invest relative to larger-scale agribusinesses due to credit constraints. The results 
      presented here reflect averages across the industry as a whole. In a scenario of ambitious action on nature, it is likely that development 
      partners and public agencies would provide financial support for investments in agriculture to reduce nature impacts.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksGold and copper are responsible for the majority 
of the African extractive sector’s impacts on 
nature through deforestation. The extractive 
sector’s greatest terrestrial impact on nature in 
Africa is the deforestation resulting from opening 
new mines or expanding existing sites. As shown 
in the top-left panel of Exhibit 16, iron, gold, and 
copper are the minerals most closely linked with 
deforestation globally, accounting for 20 percent, 
10 percent, and 7 percent, respectively, of mines in 
selected forest areas in 2020.³⁹ Gold and copper 
together accounted for 55 percent of sub-Saharan 
Africa’s extractives export revenues in 2020 – 
roughly in line with Latin America and the Caribbean, 
which have similar risk exposure (see the top-right 
panel of Exhibit 16). There is significant mining of 
gold in Ghana and of copper in Zambia and the DRC.

The association of mining products with 
deforestation may become a market access risk 
by 2030 and may generate material increases in 
unit production costs by 2050 – by 20 percent for 
gold and 33 percent for copper. Future regulation 
may require mining companies to restore the land 
they deforest and to avoid exploration in some 
protected areas. Regulations may emanate from 
local jurisdictions or from international markets such 
as the European Union, which might introduce a due 
diligence obligation on suppliers to ensure that the 
production of imported commodities has not caused 
deforestation. Costs associated with restoration, 
illegal deforestation, and strictly protected 
areas could increase unit production costs by 1 
to 3 percent in 2030 depending on the scenario 
considered compared to the baseline, and by 2 to 
33 percent by 2050. While some costs are relatively 
small, in specific markets they can make certain 
activities unprofitable. For example, calculations 
suggest that some gold mines might exit the 
market in 2040 due to a 10 percent increase in unit 
production costs in the Climate + Nature scenario. 
Other minerals produced in Africa are relatively 
unaffected by nature policies because they are not 
as strongly associated with deforestation.

In the food sector, consumers, not businesses, 
will bear most cost increases. When businesses 
face intense competition, the prices they charge 
tend to reflect the costs of production; therefore, 
when those costs change, prices adjust accordingly. 
Agricultural commodity markets are highly 
competitive markets populated by many small 
producers, and demand for staples is inelastic. 
These characteristics imply cost pass-through 

rates of 80 to 95 percent – meaning that, when 
production costs rise, the consumer prices are 
increased. For example, in Ghana in 2030 the overall 
cost of producing fruits, nuts, and vegetables would 
increase by 6 percent in the Climate Only scenario 
relative to the baseline, with a starting profit margin 
of 16 percent. Growers might pass on 83 percent of 
this cost increase to consumers, with their margin 
falling from 16 to 13 percent (see Exhibit 17).

In the minerals sector, miners would be hit 
hardest by cost increases. The market structure 
for minerals is more concentrated – there are fewer 
mining companies and some large companies that 
not which control major shares of the market.⁴⁰ As a 
result, cost pass-through rates would be lower, and 
producers would absorb more of the shock from 
rises in costs. Profit margins, then, would take a 
larger hit. For example, the results show that cost 
pass-through rates for gold producers in Ghana 
are typically around 60 percent. Under Climate + 
Nature Now, unit production costs in 2050 rise by 

17 percent relative to baseline, of which 11 percent is 
passed onto consumers. Overall, profit margins fall 
from 39 percent to 36 percent.

Rising production costs and high cost 
pass-through rates in agriculture mean that 
consumers might face price increases where 
pressure on land use is high. For example, 
theprices of fruits, nuts, and vegetables; pulses; and 
rice produced in Ghana might rise by 5 percent, 10 
percent, and 10 percent respectively in the Climate

Only scenario compared to the baseline in 2030. If 
this were to happen, vulnerable populations might 
experience inflation in food prices, which could 
affect household-level food security. The impact 
on industries that rely on agricultural commodities 
and minerals would be more limited, however, as 
raw material costs are a fraction of total costs. For 
example, in Ghanaian food manufacturing, 2030 
costs are negligible  relative to the baseline in the 
Climate Only scenario, and so profits don’t change 
significantly. The cost and profit changes mentioned 
here are only driven by the commodities covered in 
the analysis - a subset of all commodities purchased 
by food manufacturing businesses. 

Shifts in consumer demand might 
create space for nature

It may be possible to relieve pressure on land 
by preventing dietary shifts towards meat and 
dairy consumption and by cutting food waste. 
As discussed above, ambitious action to tackle the 
climate and nature crises limits the land available 
for agriculture. If consumption of conventional 
proteins such as meat and dairy in Africa follows 
patterns observed in other regions and rises with 

income, more output would be demanded from the 
land, as meat and dairy production are more land-
intensive per unit of protein produced than plant-
based or alternative proteins are. If meat and dairy 
consumption in Africa decouple from per-capita 
income growth, and current trends in consumption 
of plant-based proteins continue, some pressure 
on the food system would be alleviated. Similarly, 
reduced food waste means that less food would 
be needed to feed people. The Climate Only and 
Climate + Protection scenarios assume a 25 percent 
shift from meat and dairy consumption and a 25 
percent reduction in food waste. These figures 
increase to 50 percent under the Climate and 
Nature scenarios. (See Appendix 1 for a discussion 
of evidence relating to this shift.) These potential 
shifts would eliminate or reduce demand for a 
broad range of crops, as illustrated in Exhibit 18. In 
particular, demand for crops that are also used to 
feed livestock – such as corn and tropical roots – 
are roughly 50 percent lower in 2050 in the Climate 
and Nature scenarios as compared to the baseline.

Under ambitious action, some commodities see significantly slower demand 
growth, while others see little change.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksWhen food systems are under less pressure 
from demand, aggregate profits in agriculture 
still increase over time, albeit at a slower pace. 
Food demand in Africa is expected to keep rising 
rapidly in the next decades in all scenarios, driven 
by growth in population and per-capita income. 
Exhibit  18 shows that demand for crops such as 
maize, tropical roots, potatoes, and fruits, nuts, 
and vegetables follow an upward trajectory in all 
five scenarios – a pattern that not which applies 
to all the agriculture commodities in this analysis. 
Consequently, total profits in African agriculture also 

rise over time, no matter how ambitious the nature 
and climate actions are. Aggregate profits in the 
in-scope agricultural subsectors increase by 470 
percent between 2020 and 2050 in the baseline 
(see Exhibit 19). For instance, even in Climate + 
Nature Now scenario, which considers the most 
ambitious reductions in food demand, aggregate 
profits grow by 365 percent over the same period. 
Growth prospects are strong and robust in Africa, 
even when nature and climate constraints are 
imposed on economic activities.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
 
 
Slower demand growth reduces the pressure 
to intensify agricultural activity and limits 
short-term cost increases in parts of Africa’s 
food system. As discussed in the previous section, 
intensification driven by land scarcity can increase 
production costs in 2030 relative to baseline unit 
costs, particularly for crops grown in Central Africa. 
Slower growth in food demand helps to limit these 
increases in production costs. In the Climate Only 
scenario, intensification and protected-area costs 
increase baseline unit production costs in 2030 
for cereals, sugar cane, and palm oil. In the Climate 
+ Nature Now scenario, the same land-use drivers 
lead to declines in production costs relative to the 
baseline for cereals and sugar cane and to a more 
moderate increase in palm oil costs compared to the 
Climate Only scenario, as shown in Exhibit 20.

Lower costs help to keep food prices down, and 
more capacity in the food system ameliorates 
price volatility from short-term supply 
fluctuations, benefitting both downstream 
players and consumers. The relatively lower 
unit production costs that result from ambitious 
action to tackle nature loss help to contain price 
increases, with benefits for consumers and food 
security. When the food production system lacks 
spare capacity, short-term supply fluctuations – due 
to variable weather conditions, for example – can 
cause price volatility, particularly for commodities 
largely produced and consumed within Africa. 
Slower growth in demand would help contain 
these price fluctuations, which would in turn shield 
vulnerable populations and downstream sectors 
from price increases and volatility.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksA shift to plant-based and alternative proteins 
would bring investment opportunities. In addition 
to the manufacturing of alternative proteins, 
demand for certain crops – such as sugar cane, 
which can be used as a feedstock for fermentation 
– would rise rapidly. For example, in 2030, demand 
for sugar cane cultivated in Africa could be 15 to 

36 percent higher in all climate- and nature-action 
scenarios relative to the baseline, and almost 100 
percent higher than baseline demand by 2050 
due to feedstock demand. Total profit from these 
commodities more than doubles by 2050 in these 
scenarios relative to the baseline, as shown in

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksProducers could capture competitive 
advantages or capture new markets 

The capacity to adapt and invest is a competitive 
advantage in these disruptive scenarios. The 
results above illustrate how actions to stem climate 
change and nature loss introduce numerous 
changes to markets in Africa. Businesses in 
nature-intensive sectors will likely be adapting 
to new public policies, an evolving competitive 
landscape, and shifts in consumer preferences. 
Meanwhile, they will encounter changing physical 
risks and dependencies that affect both them and 
the markets in which they operate. The net effect is 
slower growth relative to the baseline, as depicted in 
Exhibit 22.

The disruption will create opportunities for 
several players: agribusinesses that intensify 
their agriculture activities, producers of 
alternative proteins, and extractive companies 
that can minimize their impacts on nature. 
Agribusinesses that intensify their activities in areas 

where land competition is stiff will likely outperform 
their peers who follow current practices and will 
save costs over the long term. Upstream suppliers 
selling inputs such as fertiliser and machinery 
would benefit from this rise in investment. Similarly, 
agribusinesses that not which meet new demand 
for alternative proteins would enjoy rapid growth. 
In extractives, firms may find that production in 
non-forested areas becomes cost competitive over 
time, as the costs associated with deforestation 
outweigh the benefits from working in forest 
areas with rich reserves. Firms that explore non-
forested areas and develop extraction sites with 
lower nature impacts may gain an advantage 
over competitors. Downstream players that seek 
upstream suppliers with lower nature impacts will 
also be exposed to lower levels of risk. This may 
also incentivise increased vertical integration to 
ensure transparency around nature impacts. For 
financial institutions, this implies that investments or 
lending to companies with lower nature impacts may 
outperform sector averages and reduce portfolio-
level risk.

There is more significant variation in profit 
impacts across subsectors for agriculture, than 
there is for extractives. Exhibit 23 and Exhibit 24 
present a heatmap of profit impacts under Climate 
+ Nature Now across subsectors and countries in 
2030 and 2050 respectively. Within each cell, the 
bottom-left hand triangle demonstrates the profit 
impact in 2030 and the top right-hand triangle 
demonstrates the importance of that subsector to 
the aggregate sector (agriculture or extractives). 
Across agriculture, we see a large variation of profit 
impacts across subsectors. These reflect the three 
groups of commodities discussed in Section 3: 

slow-growth commodities associated with livestock 
feed (soybean, temperate cereals, and tropical 
roots); moderate-growth commodities impacted by 
reduced food waste (fruits, nuts and vegetables); 
and high-growth commodities that benefit from diet 
shifts (alternative proteins). For extractives, impacts 
for gold and copper are relatively similar, reflecting 
the fact that the extraction of both minerals is 
associated with a similar intensity of deforestation, 
that is, the amount of deforestation associated with 
a given level of extraction.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
 
 
 
 
There is generally less variation across countries 
within a subsector. For most subsectors, financial 
impacts across countries sit within a relatively tight 
range. For example, impacts for tropical roots range 
between -2 percent and -5 percent relative to baseline, 
and impacts for temperate cereals range between 
-5 percent and -6 percent relative to baseline. For 
agricultural commodities, variation across countries is 
often driven by local levels of water stress, exposure 
to deforestation pressures, the rate of expansion 
of protected areas, and the potential pace of 
consumer and policy action on nature. For extractive 
commodities, variation across countries is driven by 

differences in national deforestation intensity, 
as defined above. These differences in intensity 
lead to quite significant differences in profit 
impacts between countries in 2050. This is also 
amplified by competitive dynamics: countries 
that are more deforestation-intensive face higher 
increases in production costs, making them less 
competitive relative to companies operating in 
countries that are less deforestation-intensive. 
This leads to losses in market share and as a 
result, profits. 

Exhibit 24 
Profit impacts in 2050 follow a similar pattern across subsectors and countries 
but are more severe.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksThe risk and opportunity assessment undertaken 
in this study, as well as engagement with 
the financial sector working group, have 
helped to identify potential challenges for the 
implementation of the TNFD framework in the 
African financial sector. As mentioned in Section 
2, the TNFD framework aims to be the globally 
coordinating framework to manage nature-related 
risks and opportunities, like those discussed in 
the preceding section. The TNFD released its 
beta framework in March 2022 to gather market 
feedback, with several future iterations to be 
released over the next year. 

The TNFD disclosure framework adapts the 
four TCFD pillars – governance, strategy, 
risk management, and metrics and targets 
(see Exhibit 25) – but with several important 
differences. First, in contrast to TCFD, the TNFD 
emphasises long-term risk and explicitly requires 
disclosure on companies’ dependencies and

impacts on nature, in addition to financial risks and 
opportunities. Second, the TNFD intends to allow 
the use of data from both corporate disclosures 
and third-party data sources, which could include 
financial ratings, geospatial data, and data and 
metrics used for the United Nations’ CBD Post-
2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Third, the 
TNFD recognises that reporters will need to build 
their understanding and capacity over time, and 
thus allows early disclosures to have a limited scope, 
such as a focus only on the most material impacts 
and dependencies and those with sufficient data 
availability. Fourth, the TNFD will provide guidance 
on how to assess the acceptability of data and to 
improve data availability over time. Fifth, the TNFD 
framework will include specific guidance on how to 
approach the interactions between climate change 
and nature loss. The TNFD promotes the use of 
integrated climate-nature scenarios as well as an 
integrated approach to transition strategies.⁴¹

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksThe beta framework presents an approach for 
financial institutions to assess nature-related 
risks and opportunities (LEAP-FI), of which 
the first three stages have been successfully 
implemented in this study. The LEAP approach 
is voluntary guidance to support corporates and 
financial institutions in undertaking internal nature-
related risk and opportunity assessments. It has 
four stages which encourage organiations to (i) 
'Locate' their interface with nature; (ii) 'Evaluate' 
their dependencies and impacts; (iii) 'Assess' 

their risks and opportunities and (iv) 'Prepare' to 
respond to and report on nature-related risks 
and opportunities. LEAP-FI is a version of the 
LEAP approach specifically targeted at financial 
institutions. It includes four initial guiding questions 
that consider the type of financial institution, the 
type of product or asset class under consideration, 
what level of aggregation is most appropriate, and 
the sectors in which the institution allocates capital, 
as illustrated in Exhibit 26.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksEngagement with the banking, asset 
management, and insurance industries across 
multiple African countries has highlighted 
key barriers that African financial institutions 
will face in managing nature-related risks and 
opportunities. This also draws from the challenges 
faced in the risk and opportunity assessment 
undertaken in this study. The identified barriers 
provide insight into how best to adjust the TNFD 
framework to ensure successful implementation 
across the continent. Priorities for consideration 
vary across different types of financial institutions. 
Banks typically face tighter regulatory requirements, 
work with shorter time horizons, and in the case 
of Africa, have greater exposure to the agriculture 
sector. Asset managers have shown greater interest 
in nature impact reporting and targets to date and 
are keen to understand how stewardship should 
account for nature. Insurers have a greater focus 
on how physical risks are likely to change the 
probability of claims on different products and 
hence, the appropriate pricing mechanism.

To ease strain on limited capacities, financial 
institutions prefer an integrated approach to 
climate and nature. Four out of five financial 
institutions in Africa are building their climate 
risk capabilities and have little appetite for 
building additional capacity to take on nature as 
a separate risk. Jurisdictions such as Kenya have 
recently announced plans to make climate-related 
disclosures mandatory, making climate risk-
reporting a compliance requirement and a priority.⁴² 
Every financial institution that corresponded with 
the authors of this report indicated that nature 
would be tackled jointly with climate. This effort 
includes extending climate-risk assessment 
frameworks, counterparty and institutional risk 
management processes, internal and external 
reporting, sustainability-linked governance, and 
strategy development processes to account for 
nature-related risk drivers. An integrated approach 
would reduce the administrative burden for clients 
as well as staff. Thus, to facilitate adoption of the 
TNFD, the institutions expect frameworks and 
processes for nature to be designed as extensions 
of climate frameworks and processes. Finance 

for Biodiversity’s (F4B) Integrated Transition 
Framework for Climate and Nature shows how such 
an integrated approach might look.⁴³

For lending to sectors with indirect exposure, 
guidance is needed. The loan books considered 
in the case studies have significant exposure to 
sectors that not which are exposed to nature-
related risks and opportunities in indirect and 
complex ways. The ways in which these sectors 
impact and depend on nature are not yet well 
understood, and hence it is difficult to include them 
in risk and opportunity assessments. Examples 
include financial services (which accounted for up to 
20 percent in some case study portfolios), tourism-
related industries (up to 7 percent), and personal 
lending (up to 30 percent). Assessing the exposure 
of these sectors will require data that is typically not 
available such as data on financial institution clients’ 
portfolios, knowledge of supply chain relationships, 
and understanding of how customer livelihoods are 
exposed to nature-related risks and opportunities. 
The latter is likely to be particularly important in 
the context of Africa where a considerable share 
of the population depend on agriculture for their 
livelihoods.

Financial institutions do not hold all the data 
relevant to counterparties’ nature-related 
risk and third-party data availability is limited. 
Many of the data required for nature-related 
assessments are not routinely collected from 
counterparties. In particular, information is 
lacking on geolocated revenue, the location of 
physical assets, corporate sustainability policies, 
and upstream and downstream supply chain 
relationships. For example, one commercial bank 
commented that, while company-level financial 
data on revenue, costs, and profits are collected 
from all clients, these data are rarely disaggregated 
across geographies and product lines. Some clients 
provide distributions at the country level, but many 
do not. As most corporate lending clients are not 
publicly listed, these data are not readily available 
from third-party data providers that collect and 
standardise company-level financial data.

52

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksClear regulatory expectations and support 
from regulators will make financial institutions 
more likely to act. Most financial institutions will 
not develop nature-related oversight capacity 
without clear signals that it will become a 
regulatory requirement. Financial institutions say 
that, if regulations are introduced, they would 
welcome guidance from regulators on how to 
incorporate nature-related scenario analysis or the 
integration of nature-related risks into stress tests. 
Organisations noted a lack of examples showing 
what constitutes effective action on nature. They 
would like to see examples of corporations and 
financial institutions that have developed nature-
related strategies or risk management frameworks.

Finally, many financial institutions already request 
additional data from clients to comply with 
conditions set by concessional finance programmes. 
These institutions are reluctant to add to the 
burden of data collection. The adoption of climate- 
and nature-related risk assessments could be 
accelerated if methods were developed to define 
and collect these data.

Financial institutions will need to attract new 
talent with relevant skills. To adopt TNFD, financial 
institutions will need to hire people with the skills 
and experience to conduct nature-related oversight, 
but the talent pool is small. Specific requirements 
include proficiency in handling spatial data, 
understanding of scientific physical processes, 
and familiarity with voluntary reporting standards. 
Staff will also need to work and coordinate across a 
number of different departments to effectively build 
risk management capacity. Framework-issuers and 
standard-setters could guide financial institutions 
on to build this capability.

55

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksFinancial institutions, financial regulators, 
framework issuers, standard-setters, and data 
providers all have roles in enabling the private 
sector to respond to and take responsibility for 
impact, risks, and opportunities related to nature. 
This section sets out some options that might enable 
the financial system to address these matters.

Financial institutions

Reporting frameworks and standards might 
enable African financial institutions to build 
the capacity for nature-related oversight. 
Frameworks and standards are already developing 
in the form of voluntary requirements and best 
practices for financial institutions to disclose 
nature-related risks and opportunities. Published in 
2018, the Natural Capital Protocol (NCP) framework 
guides organisations on how to identify, measure, 
and value their direct and indirect impact and 
dependencies on natural capital. In 2020, the 
Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) released 
an initial guide for businesses on how to assess their 
impacts and dependencies and set nature-related 
targets. In 2021, the Climate Disclosure Standards 
Board (CDSB) published guidance setting out 
an approach for reporting biodiversity-related 
risks in mainstream financial reports. Finally, the 
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) published its beta framework in March 
2022, providing a risk management and disclosure 
framework for organisations to report and act on 
nature-related risks.

Financial institutions could get started on nature 
by drawing from existing initiatives. Launched in 
2019, the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting 
Financials (PFAB) is an industry-led partnership 
of financial institutions that work together to 
explore opportunities and challenges arising from 
the assessment and disclosure of the biodiversity 
impact of their loans and investments. The Finance 
for Biodiversity Pledge, introduced in 2020, has 
several working groups of financial institutions that 
focus on assessing impact, setting and publicly 
reporting on biodiversity targets, and engaging 
with the policy community. In addition, the World 
Bank has proposed Nature Action 100, a platform 
to coordinate investor engagement on mitigating 

biodiversity loss, which is expected to launch 
during summer 2022. Finally, the African Natural 
Capital Alliance (ANCA), established by FSD 
Africa with the support of UNECA and DEFRA, is a 
collaborative forum that not which brings together 
FIs, governmental organisations, intergovernmental 
partners, and civil society representatives to 
mobilise the financial community’s response to the 
risk of nature loss in Africa.

Commercial financial institutions can prepare 
for nature-related financial disclosures in the 
following ways:

•  Assess investment and lending portfolios.  As 

outlined in Section 2, the results of our study 
indicate that where and when ambitious action 
is taken on nature, material changes may occur 
in the risk profile and value of asset portfolios. 
The risk-return character of some sectors 
and commodities may change, high-growth 
opportunities may emerge, while other areas 
may decline in performance. Risk identification 
and assessment processes can be updated to 
account for this.

•  Support customers. Financial clients and 

investees might need new services to navigate 
the net-zero and nature-positive transition. 
Such services could include helping clients 
and investees deepen their understanding of 
nature-related risks and opportunities, how 
those risks and opportunities might translate 
into financial performance, and how this 
knowledge might affect strategy and risk-
management governance.

• 

Invest in capabilities. The assessment of 
impacts, opportunities, and risks is likely to 
be complex and require staff with skills and 
expertise in spatial, natural science, economic, 
and financial data. A dedicated effort might be 
needed to recruit or build talent, or to extend 
and integrate capabilities gained from the 
management of climate-related opportunities 
and risks.

•  Upgrade support systems. Data collection 
could be critical to the robust assessment of

56

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks  nature-related opportunities and risks. New 
data infrastructure and services – including 
services from third-party providers – might be 
required. These data might span the sectoral 
and geographical distribution of investee 
revenues, the location of investee operations, 
the state of local ecosystems on which they 
depend, and the local public-policy transition 
to address the impacts of local economic 
activities on nature. Similar data might be 
gathered on investees’ supply chains. Again, 
financial institutions could integrate much of 
the information required for both climate- and 
nature-related assessments.

• 

  Engage with the TNFD. An important aspect 
of preparing for the TNFD is engaging in 
its development. By working together with 
the TNFD, African financial institutions can 
improve the fitness of the TNFD framework 
for application in Africa. Drawing from the 
lessons learned from applying the TNFD 
beta framework in this study, below are areas 
where help from the TNFD might be especially 
valuable:

 — Guidance for specific asset classes.   

 For example, the agriculture sector is 
strongly linked to the performance of 
personal loans, while tourism and other parts 
of the service sector depend on the health of 
natural ecosystems.

 — Accommodating variation in data 

availability. The TNFD framework may 
sometimes need to be applied in situations 
where relevant, sufficient data are not widely 
or readily available. Financial institutions 
could benefit from guidance on how to assess 
risks and opportunities in the absence of 
comprehensive data.

44  (World Wildlife Fund, 2021)

 — Integration with climate frameworks and 
processes. With guidance, African financial 
institutions could bypass their counterparts 
in other jurisdictions by building integrated 
climate- and nature-related oversight 
simultaneously.

Financial regulators

Financial regulators in Africa might support 
preparation by banks, asset owners, and asset 
managers by detailing their plans to integrate 
nature into regulations. The boards of financial 
institutions might welcome clear guidance from 
regulators on how they might integrate nature into 
their supervisory activities. Advance communication 
might describe how regulators plan to approach 
nature over time. For example, regulators including 
central banks and financial supervisors could 
start by regularly publishing nature-related stress 
tests and, over time, move to micro-prudential 
oversight, including risk management and capital 
requirements. As regulators undertake these 
activities, they could regularly share the lessons 
learned with the private sector.

Financial supervisors might consider adopting 
recent studies’ proposals on integrating 
nature into micro-prudential regulation, which 
would broaden the scope of micro-prudential 
supervision tools to include nature-related risks. 
Nature’s Next Stewards, a report by the World 
Wildlife Fund (WWF), explores how traditional 
micro-prudential supervision frameworks can 
help to assess and mitigate nature-related risks 
in the banking sector.⁴⁴ It suggests using and 
adapting part of the Basel III framework – a set 
of prudential banking regulations that establish 
international standards for adequate bank capital, 
stresstesting, and liquidity requirements – to 
implement preventive measures and act on the most 
exposed sectors of the economy. WWF proposes 
including nature-related risk dimensions in Basel 
III’s supervisory review process, establishing 
common principles and disclosure templates on 
nature-related risks, and adapting minimum capital 
requirements to integrate climate and biodiversity 
considerations.

57

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
The broader ecosystem

Framework issuers and standard-setters – 
including but not limited to the TNFD – might 
deploy consultative processes in each world 
region. Emerging frameworks and standards 
wouldbenefit from testing in all regions of the 
globe with institutions of diverse types and sizes 
and with different levels of data availability. This 
process could result in a flexible approach that 
suits many situations. The pilot organisations might 
act as ‘go see’ hubs for sharing best practices. 
The climate space offers a replicable model: 
global standardsetters have collaborated with 
local standardsetters to help translate the TCFD 
framework into jurisdiction-specific standards that 
reflect the practicalities of the local capital base.

Similar to regulators, policymakers might 
clearly describe the future direction of nature-
related transitions. In many jurisdictions, there 
is considerable uncertainty about the future 
public-policy response to nature loss, which makes 
accurate assessment of financial opportunities and 
risks difficult. Policymakers can help resolve this 

by clearly indicating future potential pathways for 
policy action – perhaps underpinned by time-bound, 
legally binding targets – and coordinated plans for 
sector transformations.

Finally, data providers might support 
implementation of the TNFD framework by 
engaging with framework issuers and financial 
institutions to better understand gaps in the data 
market. Data providers can improve the financial 
sector’s access to the data required for nature-
related risk assessments by developing products 
that process and present data in a format that is 
accessible to mainstream financial institutions. This 
step would also reduce the burden on financial 
institutions to perform this analysis themselves. This 
process should build from the learnings of early 
TNFD pilot programmes.

African financial institutions have the 
opportunity to test, coordinate, and shape the 
emerging global architecture on nature. By 
engaging with global initiatives such as the TNFD, 
they can drive appropriate standardisation and 
ultimately improve outcomes for investors and the 
environment.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksAppendix 1: Approach to 
opportunity and risk assessment

To assess the nature-related risk exposure of 
financial institutions, we follow a five-step approach. 
First, we develop a narrative for future demand, 
technology, and policy pathways and translate these 
into five nature scenarios. Second, the commodity-
level risk and opportunities are assessed based on 
an integrated prediction of future demand, implied 
land-use changes, and impacts on nature, as well as 
the resulting costs from the loss of nature services 
and penalties on nature impacts. Third, employing 
a competition and supply chain model, we derive 

company-level cost shocks that not which account 
for the geographic sourcing of the company, the 
characteristics of the company’s selling market 
(market structure, demand sensitivity to price, and 
competitive behaviour), and the impact on the 
companies’ profits. Fourth, the cost shocks and 
profit changes are transferred into changes in 
security values and aggregated on a portfolio level. 
The assessment is conducted using the NatuRisk 
Toolkit, as shown in Exhibit 27.

The risk assessment methodology follows a five-step approach.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks 
Scenarios

NatuRisk produces results for the five nature 
scenarios to account for the uncertain future 
demand, policy, and technology pathways.   
Each scenario represents a credible storyline for 
the evolution of key demand, policy, and technology 
levers, resulting in a range of plausible physical 
and transition risk outcomes. The purpose of the 
scenario-based approach is to provide transparency 
on the magnitude of the underlying risks and their 
key drivers.

The five climate-nature scenarios build 
on existing nature scenarios and expert 
consultations, reflecting several levels of 
ambition and coordination between climate 
and nature action. The least ambitious scenario 

describes the continuation of current policies, while 
the most ambitious scenario assumes an immediate 
and coordinated nature and climate action, which 
would result in a rapid transformation with targeted 
policy, fast-evolving demand, and the adaptation 
of new technologies. The intermediate scenarios 
vary in terms of scale, timing, and coordination of 
the climate and nature actions. Generally, scenarios 
with too little, too late, or uncoordinated climate 
or nature action tend to exhibit higher transition 
risks and physical risks. Each of the scenarios 
gives rise to a specific nature outcome that maps to 
plausible biodiversity and ecosystem pathways. The 
scenarios have been calibrated to ensure that the 
biodiversity and ecosystem outcomes match those 
projected in peer-reviewed studies and expert input.  
Exhibit 28 provides a more comprehensive overview 
of all five scenarios.

Effective area-based conservation improves 
nature integrity in key hotspots by 2030, but 
significant decline continues in other areas of 
the world. 

Trends of nature loss continue to accelerate 
to 2030 and then decelerate, leading to 
eventual reversal (i.e., positive nature trend) 
by 2050.

60

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksEach scenario is defined by a distinct pathway 
of key levers that not which support the broader 
policy, technology, and demand-change 
narrative. The scenarios are built on 22 key levers, 
which were identified as material in driving nature-
related physical and transition risk, as depicted in 
Exhibit 29. We parameterise the levers to reflect 
their relevance in a specific scenario. Broadly 
speaking, the levers can be split into two categories:

1. 

2. 

  Reactions to nature loss – stricter nature 
regulation related to protected areas or 
deforestation regulation, or demand change 
related to shifts in diets are examples – that 
create transition risks for businesses, 
depending on their current use of and 
subsequent impact on nature.

  Actions that indirectly drive changes to the 
state of nature through their impact on other 
drivers of ecosystem and biodiversity change, 
such as increased demand for biomass, and 
increased demand for metals for electric 
vehicles. Such changes in turn create 
physical risks for businesses, based on their 
dependencies on nature.

The parameter values are set in alignment 
with existing literature and scenarios. The 
levers were defined after an extensive literature 
review of current scenario projections and peer-
reviewed studies, as illustrated in Exhibit 30. When 
appropriate in relation to the narrative, lever values 
in the most ambitious scenario, Climate + Nature 
Now, were set equal to the maximum value of each 
lever reported in the literature. Specifications for 
interrelated levers are set collectively to achieve 
credible related storylines of nature ambition. For 
example, the selection of levers presented in Exhibit 
30 consistently describe changes to land-use 
pressures on nature occurring alongside required 
food system demand and technology changes 
as nature ambition increases. An increase in 
protected-area ambition occurs in conjunction with 
a greater dietary shift away from meat and dairy and 
an increased reduction in food waste. 

To calibrate the model to the characteristics of 
Africa, the parametrisation of the policy levers 
was adjusted country by country. Each scenario 
includes a narrative describing how policies and 
regulations will on average evolve. For example, in 
the Climate + Nature Now scenario, climate and

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksSector-level risk assessment

Within the model framework, nature-related 
risks and opportunities arise from, first, sector-
level dependency and, second, impacts on 
nature that not which may be constrained or 
may be associated with liabilities in the future. 
The model first assesses the dependency of the 
production of a certain commodity on nature as 
well as its impact on nature. The commodity- or 
sub-sector-level impacts are then attributed to 
companies and translated into impacts on the 
companies’ profits. By modelling what are known in 
climate risk assessment as physical and transition 
risks arising from nature dependency and impacts, 
the model builds on existing frameworks on how to 
comprehensively assess the risk and opportunities 
related to the environment.

While businesses have a wide set of nature 
impacts and dependencies, to manage the 
effort of implementing this first-of-its-kind 
assessment, the scope focuses on selected 
impacts and dependencies. Starting from a long 
list of the ways in which businesses depend on 
and impact nature, a shorter list was developed 
by ranking each impact and dependency in terms 
of its materiality to the sectors and the feasibility 
of modelling given limited data availability. The 
assessment focuses on the dependency of 
agriculture productivity on pollinators and impacts 
of agriculture and forestry production on pollinators, 
forest cover, water quality, and air quality. The set of 
in-scope impacts and dependencies map onto eight 
risk channels, as described in Exhibit 31.

The assessment considers eight risk channels.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksThe nature risks and opportunities that occur in 
the future are estimated by predicting demand 
changes, land-use changes, and the resultant 
pressure on nature. To assess future dependency 
and impacts for the commodities and countries in 
scope, we predict future global demand for these 
commodities, the geographic distribution of the 
production, the implied intensification of production, 
international trade, and land-use changes. These 
predictions consider the scenario levers described 
earlier and their impact on demand for commodities 
in the future. The predictions were generated by 
the land-use change model MAgPIE and the global 
vegetation and hydrology model LPJmL.

The outputs of the land-use change model are 
subsequently translated into cost shocks:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

  Deforestation: Costs are based on the forest 
area converted into cropland combined with 
an estimation of expenses associated with 
deforestation deterrents.  

  Protected areas: The adoption of mandatory 
standards and technologies to maintain the 
right to produce in areas that have come under 
protection increases fixed costs.   

  Pollinator loss: The impact of land-use 
changes on animal pollinator populations is 
converted into changes in crop yields.

  Air and water pollution: This is based on 
expected water and air pollution from on-farm 
activities and corresponding penalties from 
regulators.

  Water availability: We combine local water 
stress projections with the costs associated 
with irrigation technologies and production 
curtailments to measure the economic impact 
of water dependency. 

  Soil quality: Changes in yields arising from 
changes in soil salinity, due to water stress, 
represent a unit cost increase. 

Finally, the cost drivers are aggregated by 
commodity and translated into average unit cost 
increases, which feed into the company-level impact 
assessment.

Company-level impacts

The company-level impacts are determined 
by the supply chain geographic footprint and 
the competitive landscape. First, we identify 
company-level cost shocks by combining company-
level revenue data with data on trade patterns 
and identifying the sourcing markets of each 
company. This allows us to derive a weighted 
average cost shock for each company, depending 
on its geographic footprint. In addition, we 
deploy a competition model which considers the 
company’s competitiveness and the characteristics 
of the market in which it operates to estimate the 
company’s ability to pass through the cost shock 
and the impact on its volume of sales. The net result 
is the impact on profit. Second, the price change 
for primary goods is translated into cost shocks 
for secondary sectors using sector-level input-
output mapping, again considering the geographic 
pattern of the supply chain. Again, after running the 
competition model, we arrive at estimates for the 
company’s profit change.

For non-publicly listed (private) companies, a 
sector-representative cost and geographic 
profile is constructed to compensate for 
missing data. Many financial institutions provide 
a significant share of their lending to private 
companies. Unfortunately, relevant data on these 
companies are scarce. To overcome this challenge, 
we construct a typical private company profile 
based on cost and supply chain data from public 
companies as well as expert interviews. This enables 
us to estimate the nature-related risk exposure of 
financial institutions more comprehensively.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksPortfolio-level impacts

Portfolio-level impacts are derived by first 
translating profit impacts into asset valuation 
changes and then aggregating those at the 
portfolio level. To translate profit impacts into 
portfolio-level impacts, we first employ an asset 
valuation model which provides value changes for 
bonds, stocks, and other securities as well as the 
default likelihood and the loss in case of default. 
The changes in equity value are directly calculated

by assessing the change in the discounted sum of 
future profits. The estimation of the loan book value 
change is slightly more complex. The estimation 
follows a five-step approach illustrated in Exhibit 32. 
Finally, changes in security values are aggregated 
at the portfolio level. For financial institutions and 
systems for which we only have commodity- or 
sector-level data, the portfolio-level impact is 
assessed based on a synthetic portfolio – that 
is, a hypothetical but representative selection of 
companies.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksAppendix 2: Context and coverage 
for top-priority countries

This section provides additional background 
on the coverage and national context of five 
countries that are highlighted throughout the 
analysis: Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, and 
South Africa. First, for the agriculture sector, this 
section describes the share of the national crop 
mix covered by the commodities included in the risk 
assessment. Second, it presents the national data 
points that were used to assess the potential future 
stringency of policy and regulatory action on nature 
for different countries under our different scenarios.

• 

• 

  National crop mix: Each of the five countries 
has a diverse crop composition (Exhibit 
34), which was mapped to the value of crop 
production (based on data from the Food 
and Agriculture Organization, or FAO) to 
understand the assessment’s coverage of 
the national agricultural sector. Across Africa, 
the scope of the risk assessment covers 87 
percent of agriculture in terms of value. The 
broadest coverage achieved is in Mauritius, 
where modelled commodities cover over 99 
percent of actual output. Ghana, South Africa, 
and Egypt also exhibit high coverage, with 
respective shares of 98 percent, 97 percent, 
and 93 percent. The share of commodities in 
scope is slightly lower in Kenya, at 71 percent. 
Beyond coverage, Exhibit 34 also illustrates 
the composition of crops in Africa and the five 
prioritised countries. The most prevalent crops 
in Africa are mixed fruits and vegetables and 
tropical roots, which respectively represent 
35 percent and 21 percent of total agricultural 
production value. Each of the five countries has 
a different crop mix. In Egypt and South Africa, 
mixed fruits and vegetables are the primary 

crop by value, covering 49 percent and 56 
percent of crops respectively. Similarly, mixed 
fruits and vegetables constitute the largest 
crop by value in Ghana and Kenya, averaging 
25 percent of overall value. Ghana produces 
mostly tropical roots, which represent as much 
as 60 percent of total crop production. Kenya, 
on the other hand, has the most diversified crop 
output of the five countries; mixed fruits and 
vegetables and corn are the largest Kenyan 
crops by value, accounting for, respectively, 
25 percent and 16 percent of total production. 
Finally, in Mauritius, sugar cane represents 90 
percent of crop value.

  Policy stringency inputs: As outlined in 
the methodology section, overall policy 
stringency is based on three factors: policy 
need, policy ambition, and policy feasibility. 
The country fact sheets presented in Exhibit 
35 summarise the key observed indicators 
underlying our methodology. Biodiversity 
intactness, forest cover, deforestation, and 
signs of air and water pollution indicate how 
rapidly nature is degrading and hence the 
need for nature-related policies to reverse this 
trend. Observed climate commitments and 
policies like the COP26 Global Forest Finance 
Pledge, the submission of enhanced NDCs 
(nationally determined contributions), or the 
implementation of a carbon price typically 
signal policy ambition, which might indicate 
countries that are likely to be early movers. 
The average of the world governance index is 
considered as a proxy for policy feasibility – 
that is, the likelihood that nature policies will be 
enacted and enforced consistently over time.

Qualitative ranking of very low to very high reflects each countries relative ranking compared to other Africa countries. Very low:  below 20th percen 
tile; Low: between 20th and 40th percentile; Medium: between 40th and 60th percentile; High: between 60th and 80th percentile; Very high: above  
80th percentile. Biodiversity Intactness Index reflects the share of original species that remain in an area despite human pressure. Nutrient budget is  
the difference between nutrient input (e.g., fertilizer) and output (e.g., absorption through plants) with a nutrient surplus being a warning indicator for  
fertilizer overuse. The level of phosphorus and nitrogen pollution is measured by the grey water footprint., the amount of water required to dissipate  
the pollutant load normalised by local water availability. Water stress is measured by the ratio of water demand to water availability. Air Quality Index  
(AQI) measures the level of air pollution considering five pollutants – namely, ground-level ozone, particle pollution (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon  
monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. A low AQI indicates a low level of air pollution. The Worldwide Governance Indicator assesses a  
country’s governance across five dimensions – namely, Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government  
Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, Control of Corruption – based on 30 individual data sources including enterprise, citizen and expert  
survey respondents. A country’s climate ambition was assessed based on whether a country has published an enhanced Nationally Determined  
Contributions and a Long-term Strategy, as well as whether a country is considering, has scheduled the implementation of or implemented a carbon  
price and/ or an emissions trading system.

Appendix 3: Risk definitions and 
taxonomy

This appendix discusses in more detail the types 
of risks and opportunities that are assessed 
within the analysis. First, this section provides a 
definition of nature and ecosystem services and 
describes how they relate to business activity. 
Second, it presents a taxonomy of nature-related 
risks and opportunities aligned with the TNFD beta 
framework. Third, it discusses how risks in the real 
economy translate to risks for financial institutions. 
Fourth, it discusses the interactions between 
climate- and nature-related risks and opportunities.

Nature, ecosystem services, and their 
economic value

Nature is undoubtedly in decline, but its 
economic impact is not always obvious or easy to 
quantify. Human activity has significantly altered 75 
percent of land surface, 40 percent of invertebrate 
pollinators face extinction, and 32 million hectares 
of primary or recovering forest were lost between 
2010 and 2015.⁴⁶ A key challenge in quantifying the 
economic impact of nature decline is linking nature 
to economic activities and assessing the materiality 
of the link. This section introduces nature and its 
associated risks and opportunities.

Nature, ecosystem services, and natural capital 
are closely related but different concepts. Nature 
encompasses the living things, minerals, and water 
on our planet, as well the Earth’s features, forces, 
and processes, such as the weather. Biodiversity 
is a core component of these features. Natural 
ecosystems provide critical ecosystem services 
that benefit humans, such as providing food and 
water, supporting the cycling of nutrients, regulating 
climate and floods, and providing recreational and 
spiritual benefits (details in Box 1).⁴⁷ Natural capital 
is the combined stock of nature and ecosystem 
services globally. While this report mostly employs 
the terms ‘nature’ and ‘ecosystem services’, other 
publications on nature risk management might 
use the term ‘natural capital’. This term effectively 
reframes nature as an asset class which can be 
quantified, tracked against common targets, and 
even valued in monetary terms. Natural capital is 
typically used in the context of asset management. 
The terms ‘nature’ and ‘ecosystem services’ are 
more common in the context of setting preservation 
targets or defining new regulations and disclosure 
standards.

46  (IPBES, 2019) and (IPBES, 2016)
47  While this report mainly uses the terms ‘nature’ and ‘natural services’, these terms could in many instances be interchanged with the term 
      ‘natural capital’, which describes the stock of nature assets and related nature services

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksA large share of economic activities directly 
depends on nature and its services. To make this 
more tangible, consider the following figure: US $8 
billion of gross value-add is generated by the three 
largest sectors that directly depend on nature’s 
resources or services: construction, agriculture, and 
food and beverages.⁴⁸ Businesses often depend on 
ecosystem services such as:

1.  Direct inputs (provisioning services). Nature 
provides fibres for agricultural production, 
wood for construction, biomass for energy 
production, and genetic material for drug 
development. For instance, about 75 percent 
of anti-tumour drugs that not which have 
been approved in the past 70 years are non-
synthetic, and 49 percent of anti-tumour drugs 
are natural products or directly derived from 
natural products.⁴⁹ . Moreover, nature maintains 
critical waterflow for agriculture and many 
industrial production processes.

2.  Enablement of production (supporting 

services). Nature supports agriculture 
production through services like animal 
pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling. 
An estimated 75 percent of food crops depend 
at least somewhat on animal pollination, and 
wild pollinators cannot be replaced by managed, 
man-made alternatives.⁵⁰Mining and chemical 
companies rely on nature’s capacity to absorb 
their emissions and recycle their wastewater. 
Other companies more generally depend on 
natural waterways for transporting their goods.

3.  Protection from disasters (regulating 
services). Mangroves, coral reefs, and 
wetlands offer effective protection by 
dissipating energy and moving water from 
storm surges and floods. Mangroves in 
particular are estimated to annually offer 
protection worth USD $65 billion.⁵¹ In addition, 
vegetation can reduce the risk of landslides 
(and soil erosion) during extreme precipitation 
events.⁵² Nature helps to protect business 
activities as well, including the production 
and transport of goods. Beyond that, nature 
significantly contributes to global climate 
regulation by sequestering roughly 60 percent 
of global anthropogenic greenhouse-gas 
emissions and therefore indirectly helps to 
mitigate climate change.⁵³  More detail on the 
climate nexus is provided later in this section.

Even businesses that not which do not directly 
depend on nature can be indirectly dependent 
through their supply chain. Supply chain 
dependence occurs when a sector purchases inputs 
that not which directly depend on nature. Prominent 
examples of such downstream dependency are the 
food processing, apparel, and cosmetics sectors, 
which heavily rely on nature-based inputs from the 
agriculture sector (for example, rice, grains, shea 
butter, and cotton). For six purchasing industries – 
chemicals and materials; aviation, travel and tourism; 
real estate; mining and metals; supply chain and 
transport; and retail, consumer goods, and lifestyle 
– more than 50 percent of their supply chains’ gross 
value-added (GVA) moderately or highly depends 
 on nature.⁵⁴

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksBusinesses activities can also negatively and 
positively impact nature’s health and vitality 
– and hence its ability to provide ecosystem 
services. The IPBES has identified five key drivers 
of nature loss: changes in land and sea use, direct 
exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution, 
and invasion of alien species. All five of these drivers 
are linked to various economic activities. Land-use 
change arguably has had the most negative impact: 
in 2019, 75 percent of land surface globally had 
already been significantly altered, and 66 percent of 
ocean areas are experiencing increasing, cumulative 
impacts. Between 2001 and 2020, 10 percent of 
global tree cover has been lost; roughly 30 percent 
of this loss has been driven by commodity demand 
(such as, palm oil, logging, mining) and is expected 
to be permanent.⁵⁵ . The degradation of nature 
predominantly affects the availability of supporting, 
regulating nature services. Habitat destruction 
and overuse of pesticides and herbicides have 
helped to bring 40 percent of insects under threat 
of extinction, which in turn threatens the availability 
of pollination services.⁵⁶ Moreover, worldwide, 20 
percent of cropland, 16 percent of forest land, 19 
percent of grassland, and 27 percent of rangeland 
show a decline in productivity due to water 
withdrawal and soil contamination, degradation, 
and erosion, which puts agriculture productivity at 
risk.⁵⁷ The clearing of mangroves for agriculture 
production and in particular aquaculture and the 
loss of coral reefs due to anthropogenic climate 
change have reduced protection from hurricanes 
and floods, putting 100 million to 200 million people 
at higher risk of experiencing severe impacts from 
hurricanes and floods.⁵⁸ 

Nature-related risks and opportunities

Nature-related risks and opportunities arise 
from the dependency and impact of business 
activities on nature. More specifically, nature 
dependencies expose businesses to physical 
risks and opportunities, while nature impacts 
expose business activities to transition risks and 
opportunities.

Nature-related physical risks and opportunities 
are driven by dependencies and can be chronic or 
acute. Physical risk comes from two sources. First, 
the loss of natural inputs and nature services that 
enable production physically hinders companies 
from producing or buying primary inputs for 
production. Since these nature services only 
deteriorate because of long-term ecosystem shifts, 
the implied risk is chronic and materialises over time. 
Second, the loss of natural protection can cause 
material damages to companies’ physical assets, 
critical infrastructure, and supply chains. The 
implied risk is acute, depending on the occurrence 
of natural disasters. For both sources of physical 
risk, a company’s exposure is proportional to its 
dependency – that is, the share of production 
depending on certain natural commodities, or the 
share of production facilities located in coastal 
areas that are historically protected by coastal 
vegetation.

Nature-related transition risks and opportunities 
are driven by impacts and aspects of the 
transition to a nature-positive economy. 
Essentially, three key drivers prompt transition 
risk: new policies and regulation, innovation, and 
consumer shifts.

•  Nature policies and regulation. As the 

deterioration of nature advances, policymakers 
and regulators are expected to implement 
new measures to support a shift towards more 
nature-positive outcomes. Nature-focused 
measures could potentially include the 
expansion of protected areas, the introduction 
of taxes on land- or pollution-intensive goods, 
or mandatory disclosure of a company’s nature 
impacts. Such interventions will likely increase 
companies’ cost of production and thus 
reduce their profitability. In extreme scenarios, 
companies might lose their license to operate. 
However, these shifts also create significant 
opportunities for businesses whose activities 
support nature.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risks•  Disruptive innovations. Companies will 

try to develop and deploy new, innovative 
technologies or business models that not which 
reduce their dependency or impact on nature. 
Successful innovations will create opportunities 
for disruptors, while other companies may be 
left behind.

•  Consumer shifts. Demand for nature-

neutral or nature-positive products will grow 
as nature loss intensifies and awareness of 
nature’s critical role in solving the climate 
crisis increases. Companies that harm nature 
may face reputational risk and lose market 
share, while those that can demonstrate that 
they are profitable but not harmful will have 
a competitive edge. These latter companies 
will be able to access high-growth markets for 
sustainable products.

Value of nature-related risk 
management for financial institutions 
and systems

Financial institutions can create value by 
effectively managing nature-related risk and 
opportunities in four ways: improving portfolio 
management, preparing for new policies and 
regulations, effectively managing their reputation, 
and adapting their commercial strategy.  Exhibit 
36 presents a transmission mechanism showing 
how a business’s impacts and dependencies on 
nature can create financial risks and opportunities, 
and how these can then create financial risks and 
opportunities for financial institutions that lend to 
those businesses.

Counterparties’ impacts and dependencies on nature can be translated to

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksFirst, at the portfolio level, nature-related risk 
management can enable financial institutions 
to de-risk their portfolios. Independent of 
whether a financial institution generates revenues 
from financial investment, corporate lending, or 
insurance underwriting, the failure to sufficiently 
recognise counterparties’ nature-related risk 
exposure will result in overvaluation. Investments 
will underperform, corporates will be more likely to 
default on their debt, and insurance premiums will 
be too low compared to actual claims. Moreover, 
financial institutions may face litigation risk from 
financing illicit harm to nature or insufficiently 
disclosing known nature-related risks, as 
they are beginning to experience with climate 
action.⁵⁹’⁶⁰ Financial institutions can mitigate credit, 
operational, liquidity, and litigation risks by building 
up nature-related risk assessment capabilities and 
incorporating these into their investment, lending, 
and underwriting processes.

Second, financial institutions can minimise 
compliance costs and disruptions by preparing 
for regulatory requirements ahead of time. 
Financial regulators are paying more attention to 
nature-related risks. For example, the Dutch and 
French central banks have conducted their first 
nature stress tests, and the Network for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS) is expected to soon 
develop nature-related scenarios. Drawing from 
this experience with climate action, it is reasonable 
to expect that nature-related risk assessments, 
disclosures, and stress-testing may become 
mandatory in the future. Getting ahead and building 
the relevant capabilities are essential to prepare for 
these emerging requirements and to avoid future 
operational disruptions.

Third, financial institutions should act on nature 
to mitigate the reputational risk that could result 
from client and shareholder pressure. As they 
did after the Paris Agreement, both shareholders 
and customers are increasingly pressuring financial 
institutions to align their operations with clear 

nature targets. Financial institutions that fail to act 
on their shareholders’ and customers’ expectations 
may incur less favourable terms of finance and loss 
of market share. Financial institutions that act early 
– by committing to meet established nature targets, 
for example – will have a better chance of avoiding 
reputational risk and may also build a strong, trusted 
brand profile that lends them a competitive edge.

Fourth, by aligning their activities with nature-
positive impacts and offering products that cater 
to clients who are concerned about nature loss, 
financial institutions can seize new commercial 
opportunities. In the next few years, demand from 
retail and institutional investors for investment 
products with a positive impact on nature could 
increase substantially, as they did for HSBC Bank 
and its climate-related products. Banks and asset 
managers could grow their business by developing 
new and innovative nature-focused investment 
products. Some financial institutions have already 
developed nature-positive products such as the 
HSBC Pollination Fund and Mirova Natural Capital 
funds.

Nature-related risk management can also help 
support financial system stability. Because 
nature-related risks are systemic, crossing 
sectors and extending along supply chains, severe 
nature loss and nature-focused regulations could 
drive economic losses simultaneously in several 
sectors. Shocks to the real economy can spill 
over to the financial sector and create financial 
instability. This connection between nature-related 
risk and financial stability has been recognized 
by 66 members of Network for Greening the 
Financial System (NGFS), which emphasises that 
nature-related risks are ‘therefore within the 
mandates of central banks and supervisors’.⁶¹ Thus, 
financial supervisors and regulators can support 
financial stability by promoting nature-related risk 
management among financial institutions within 
their financial system and by incorporating nature-
related risks into the micro- and macro-prudential 
oversight frameworks. 

59   In the latter case, financial institutions are typically protected by limited liability, and in some legal systems lenders are already restricted 
       from financing projects that not which cause harm – as with the rules and precedents created by Brazil’s National Environmental Policy Law,      
     for example, together with jurisprudence from the Superior Court of Justice and the higher courts of the Brazilian states

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksThe climate-nature nexus

The planet’s climate and nature systems are 
deeply interconnected, causing climate change 
and nature loss to reinforce and exacerbate 
one another. Climate change is a key driver of 
nature loss. For example, coral reefs, which are 
particularly vulnerable to increases in temperature, 
are projected to decline to 10 to 30 percent of 
former cover at 1.5°C warming and to less than 1 
percent at 2°C warming.⁶² At the same time, nature 
significantly contributes to global climate regulation. 
Marine and terrestrial ecosystems support climate 
regulation by sequestering roughly 60 percent of 
global anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions.⁶³ 
Thus, as global warming accelerates, nature loss will, 
too, which in turn will further contribute to climate 
change.

An integrated approach to climate and nature 
will lead to more accurate estimations of risk 
exposure and allow businesses to develop a 
consistent net-zero carbon and nature-positive 
transition strategy that captures synergies 
between climate and nature. An integrated 
framework has two key features:

•  Compounding climate- and nature-related 
risks. Some nature- and climate-related 
risks overlap and are not simply additive. 
For instance, climate change increases the 
likelihood of coastal flooding, while nature 
loss decreases the availability of natural 
protection from flooding. Both effects jointly 
compound the risk exposure of coastal areas 
to flooding. The same applies to transition 
risks. For example, climate change contributes 
to the dieback of forest – independent of 
human-induced deforestation – which further 
accelerates climate change. Taken together, 
these two effects intensify the need for forest 
protection measures and therefore compound 
transition risk exposure related to nature-

protection regulation. More broadly, when 
considering climate change and nature loss 
together, environmental degradation will occur 
at a quicker pace. This implies that we will also 
need a quicker transition.

•  Uncertainty about climate and nature 

pathways. The future pathways of climate 
and nature are highly uncertain and depend 
on various external conditions – such as the 
speed of change in climate dynamics, the 
adaption of new technologies, and regulation. 
Scenario analysis is used to account for these 
uncertainties, with each scenario describing a 
plausible future pathway based on consistent 
assumptions about external drivers. Given the 
interconnection between climate and nature, 
it is both practical and necessary to integrate 
potential nature loss and potential nature 
policies into climate scenarios. Integrated 
scenarios can help ensure consistency 
between climate- and nature-related risk 
assessments.

Financial institutions and supervisors can 
deploy an integrated framework to assess and 
manage climate- and nature-related risks and 
opportunities. A joint framework allows climate 
and nature strategies to be aligned, climate and 
nature interactions to be effectively accounted for, 
and impacts to be assessed in aggregate. With an 
integrated framework, financial institutions and 
supervisors can leverage synergies and ensure the 
alignment of both assessments. The risk typologies 
(for example, physical, transition, and systemic 
risks) for climate and nature are similar, allowing 
for a smooth integration. A detailed proposal for an 
integrated framework can be found in a report by 
the Finance for Biodiversity (F4B) initiative, Towards 
an Integrated Transition Framework.⁶⁴

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksAppendix 4: Evolving regulatory
ecosystem

Following the example of TCFD, the Taskforce 
on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) 
was formed in 2020 to develop a framework for 
assessing and acting on nature-related risks. 
After the 2008 financial crisis, banks were asked 
to disclose more fully their exposure to certain 
types of risks, and scenario-based stress-testing 
was introduced. As awareness of the materiality of 
climate-related risk grew, the TCFD was established 
in 2015 to ‘help identify the information needed 
by investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters 
to appropriately assess and price climate-related 
risks and opportunities’, as well as to provide a 
reporting framework for financial and non-financial 
institutions for climate-related disclosures.⁶⁵ Over 
time, the discourse about nature loss, its connection 
to climate change, and its impact on the global 
economy broadened. As a result, the TNFD was 
established to identify the information needed for 
financial institutions and companies to understand 
their dependency and impact on nature, as well as 
how nature loss will affect their short- and long-
term financial performance. The scope of the TNFD 
includes living nature and elements related to living 
nature, such as air, soil, and water. 

In the first quarter of 2022, the TNFD published 
its first ‘beta’ framework for reporting on 
nature-related risks. The TNFD will follow an open-
innovation approach, moving quickly to engage the 
market with an outline of the proposed framework 
and then learning through feedback from, and 
iteration with, market participants. The beta 
framework includes:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

   An overview of the vision and aims of 
 the framework

  TNFD’s principles for a risk management and 
reporting framework 

  Definitions and taxonomies relating to nature-
related impacts, dependencies, and risks 

  Core recommendations on what should be 
disclosed by reporting entities

  Guidance that takes the user on a ‘how-
to’ journey from nature-related impacts 
and dependencies to risk and opportunity 
identification, with links to relevant third-party 
tools, guidance, and processes

• 

  An overview of the framework’s future 
development

According to the TNFD’s workplan, the final 
nature-related disclosure framework can be 
expected in 2023. Following the recent publication 
of the TNFD beta framework, the TNFD will 
engage with financial institutions and corporations 
across geographies to promote the testing of the 
framework. Based on the insights received from 
the TNFD pilots, the framework will be updated. The 
testing phase will be followed by a shorter period 
of stakeholder consultations to gather further 
feedback and to ensure that the TNFD framework 
builds on recommended tools, measurement 
systems, and reporting protocols.

the framework

Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures

In 2023, the TNFD will deliver a framework for 
organisations to report and act on evolving 
nature-related risks, in order to support a shift in global 
financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes and 
toward nature-positive outcomes

TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, 2021)

Like the TCFD framework, the TNFD framework 
is expected to be translated into standards and 
eventually embedded into regulations. The TNFD 
framework is the first step, providing initial guidance 
on how to identify and assess nature-related risks 
and opportunities and outline the information that 
should be disclosed so that investors and regulators 
can make more informed choices. Over time, the 
TNFD framework is expected to be translated into 
standards with practical, concrete, and granular 
details that can be verified by auditors. The beta 
framework already aligns with guidance from the 
IFRS International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB). As has been the case for climate, emerging 
global standards for nature-related risk disclosure 
are expected to be adopted by local regulators and 
adapted for mandatory regulations.

While it is difficult to predict the exact timing, 
the TNFD framework is likely to be integrated 
into standards and regulations more quickly 
than the TCFD. Seven years passed between 
the inauguration of the TCFD in 2015 and the first 
national mandate for climate-related financial 
disclosure in the UK, as well as the first climate 
stress-test exercise by the European Central 
Bank. Given the interconnections between climate 
and nature and the fact that the TNFD, global 

standardsetters, and regulators can build on the 
experience gained from the TCFD process, it 
is reasonable to expect a considerably shorter 
timeline between the development of the TNFD 
framework and the first nature-related disclosure 
mandates.

Standard-setters and financial supervisors 
have already started their work on nature-
related risks and opportunities. For example, 
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) published its 
first biodiversity standard (GRI 304) in 2016 and is 
expected to publish a revised version in 2022. The 
IFRS ISSB is expected to work on a global nature 
standard starting in 2023. The Climate Disclosure 
Standards Board (now part of the IRFS ISSB) 
launched guidance on how to assess and disclose 
biodiversity and water-related risks, including a list 
of impact drivers and example metrics. Moreover, 
the Science Based Target Network (SBTN) is 
revising its initial guidance for businesses on how 
to set nature targets. As mentioned above, some 
central banks are moving at a similar fast pace and 
developing nature-related stress-test capabilities. 
The Dutch and French central banks, for example, 
have highlighted the materiality of nature-related 
risks in their first stress-tests. The NGFS has 
also convened a study group to consider the links 
between nature loss and financial stability.

Nature and financial institutions in Africa: A first assessment of opportunities and risksList of exhibits

Exhibit 1. We consider five scenarios of action on climate and/or nature and a baseline.

Exhibit 2. Exposure to agriculture and extractives together ranges from 2 percent to 20 percent of 
total portfolio value.

Exhibit 3. By 2030, total equity value could fall by up to 5 percent under Climate + Nature Now. 

Exhibit 4. By 2030, total loan book values could change by +0.3 percent to -0.6 percent under 
Climate + Nature Now.

Exhibit 5. By 2030, total loan book values could fall by up to -0.4 percent under Climate + Protection.

Exhibit 6. Nature-related risks could roughly double expected losses from agriculture by 2030                         
for some portfolios.

Exhibit 7. Nature-related risks in deforestation-linked extraction and crop production are of a         
comparable scale to climate-related risks in manufacturing, chemicals, and extractives.

Exhibit 8. By 2030, the equity value of agriculture producers could increase and decline                                      
between +55.5 percent and -22.0 percent under Climate + Nature Now.

27

Exhibit 9. By 2030, lending to agriculture could see gains and losses between +5.4 percent and -3.2 
percent under Climate + Nature Now.

28

Exhibit 10. By 2030, equity value of extractives companies could increase and decline up to +1                                
and -3.7 percent under Climate + Nature Now.      

29

Exhibit 11. By 2030, lending to extractives could see losses up to 2.6 percent under Climate + Nature                     
Now.

Exhibit 12. Changes in loan book and equity value are estimated based on firm-level profit                       
changes.

Exhibit 13. Water stress significantly raises production costs.

Exhibit 14. Tourists are attracted by species richness, making tourism vulnerable to habitat and              
species loss.

Exhibit 15. Limited land availability could significantly increase agricultural production costs by                   
2030.

Exhibit 16. Deforestation could quickly become a market access risk for gold and copper                          
exported from Africa.

Exhibit 17. Agricultural producers pass a high proportion of costs onto consumers.
