Letter to medtech leaders 

The medtech industry has had a tremendous impact on society and has improved quality of life for billions. Innovations 
have changed treatment paradigms for complex conditions, expanded access to care, and provided more options to 
healthcare providers and patients for improved disease management. 

The past few years have challenged the medtech industry in unprecedented ways. The lasting impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic has led to permanent shifts across the healthcare landscape. Macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties 
continue to loom. Shareholder returns have started to stagnate. Resilience has become increasingly important.

This is the time for leaders to act boldly in anticipation of the next wave of value creation. As you embark on this journey, 
consider these questions: 

• What strategic shifts could position your organization to capture the next wave of growth? 

• Against a backdrop of persistent market uncertainties, where can you invest to capitalize on new value pools?

•  What new capabilities will your organization need in order to deliver on the industry’s potential?

•  What actions are you taking personally to effectively lead and bolster the resilience of your organization?

With this report, we seek to provide insights and perspectives to inform the journey ahead, starting with a look at 
shifting the value creation equation and how it influences medtech’s next act. We follow with an examination of topics 
that are of paramount importance to medtech leaders and that, we believe, will propel the next decade of value creation.

As medtech companies emerge from the COVID-19 
pandemic, leaders are scrutinizing operations to find ways 
to better serve patients and bolster competitiveness.

Committing to ESG as a differentiator
An environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy 
is not merely a compliance checklist item; it is an untapped 
opportunity for medtech companies to differentiate  
their devices. 

62

Updating the post-COVID-19 playbook for M&A
M&A could help the medtech industry boost value 
creation, but only if companies can adapt their dealmaking 
approaches to changing macroeconomic conditions.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade 
 
Billions of patients, families, and healthcare workers 
around the world rely on the medtech industry every 
year. Medtech plays a major role in their lives, from an 
ultrasound’s detection of a baby’s first heartbeat to 
an electrocardiogram’s record of a person’s last. In 
between, Band-Aids cover scrapes, stents reopen 
vessels, and robots resect tumors. For decades, 
medtech innovations have helped people live longer, 
healthier, and happier lives: 

 — Since 1980, medtech advancements have  
added five years to US life expectancy.1   

 — An estimated 10 percent of the US population will 
have medical devices implanted in their bodies.2  

 — Medtech companies employ more than two 

million people around the world.3   

 — Medtech’s value is cost-effective: since 2009, 

prices for medical devices have increased at 
one-seventh the rate of the broader medical 
consumer price index.4   

 — In 2023, the medtech industry is estimated to 

grow to nearly $600 billion,5 with rising access to 
care and new innovations positioning the market 
for 5 to 6 percent annual growth through 2026.6  

The industry continues to expand its impact. 
Consider the mother of two who avoided a stroke 
thanks to innovations in atrial fibrillation, the 
diabetic who replaced daily finger pricks with 
continuous glucose monitors, and the overworked 
nurse who saved a patient’s life with the help 
of digitally enabled remote monitoring. All told, 
medtech companies have created more than two 
million types of medical devices for patients and 
caregivers around the world.7 With a focus on 
patient impact, medtech companies have largely 

aligned their innovation priorities with areas of 
highest unmet need (Exhibit 1).

Companies have an opportunity— 
and responsibility—to transform  
the industry
Despite the value created for patients in the past 
decade, many are still waiting. Across therapeutic 
areas and geographies, patients remain unserved 
and are still coping with conditions that medtech 
could potentially ameliorate or cure. In the United 
States, more than 50 percent of 2021 deaths 
were preventable,8 patient experience remains 
highly variable, and the financial burden of 
cardiovascular conditions alone is projected to 
grow rapidly, doubling between 2017 and 2035.9 
Medtech leaders have the opportunity and the 
responsibility to continue to grow, innovate, and 
create value for patients and caregivers around 
the world.

Additionally, companies should consider how to 
unlock the next era of value creation for shareholders. 
Fifteen years ago, the medtech industry faced a wave 
of disruptions resulting from the Great Recession and 
other events. In response, the industry reinvented 
itself, accelerating innovation on its way to top-tier 
shareholder returns. Medtech posted a stellar run of 
value creation for much of the 2010s, outperforming 
the S&P 500 by nearly twofold in the 2012–19 period.  
Since 2019, however, investor skepticism has returned;  
the S&P 500 has beaten medtech every year, and 
valuation multiples for the highest-growth companies 
have been more than halved since (Exhibit 2).

Creating value for patients and shareholders over 
the next decade will require another industry 
reinvention, with a bias toward transformation, not 
incremental improvement.

Medtech leaders have multiple 
transformation strategies to consider
Against this backdrop, leaders could consider 
pursuing one or more transformation strategies to 
lead value creation in the future:

Create the next frontier of innovation. With 
millions of patients still unserved and the rising 
cost of care a chronic concern, demand for 
medtech innovation remains high. Thanks to 
advances in miniaturization, new materials, and 
digitalization, companies are increasingly able 
to focus on “premium innovation” to meet this 
demand. For example, new, minimally invasive 
treatments such as transcatheter technologies are 
improving outcomes and expanding access for the 
sickest patients. Remote-monitoring solutions that 
shift patients out of intensive care units (ICUs) and 
into more comfortable care settings are bending 
the cost curve and improving patient experience. 

Leading innovators in these and other categories 
will continue to capture the hearts and minds of 
patients, healthcare workers, and shareholders. 
From 2017 through May 2023, companies in 
the top quartile of novel product approvals saw 
shareholder returns almost twice as high as those 
in the second and third quartiles (and four times 
higher than those in the bottom quartile).10 As 
rewards for innovation have risen, so have market 
expectations for what constitutes innovation. R&D 
spending has accelerated, growing at twice the 
rate of industry sales since 2019 (up from being on 
par with sales in the 2010s).11 Clinical-trial volumes, 
which remained flat from 2015 to 2019, are now 
growing at 11 percent annually,12 and customer 
expectations for clinical data (safety, efficacy, and, 
often, cost-efficiency) are rising.

As medtech moves into this next generation of 
innovation, companies will need to consider how best

to participate (organically or inorganically) in premium 
areas of innovation and generate clinical evidence to 
better serve patients and outperform competitors.

Reassess approaches to incremental innovation. 
Although premium technologies garner headlines, 
incremental innovation remains critical in 
responding to user feedback and improving 
shortcomings in established products. However, 
incremental innovation has recently had an outsize 
presence in companies’ pipelines, with limited 
end-user benefit. In portfolio reviews across the 
industry, managers justify incremental programs 
as significant upgrades critical to retaining share, 
only to be met with skepticism from physicians and 
price pressure from purchasers. As a result, the 
slow-growth portion of the market has doubled 
since 2012.13 With buyer scrutiny heightening, 
companies will have to be more efficient and 
creative with their resource allocation.  

For established products, companies should 
evaluate digital solutions and services as a new 
source of value. If the opportunity for adding 
meaningful value is low, leaders will need to 
consider shifting resources elsewhere. 

Going forward, companies should apply more scrutiny 
to resources dedicated to incremental innovation and 
consider if a business without “premium” innovation 
has a role in the portfolio of the future.  

Enable the shift to new care sites. Provider 
systems are racing to treat patients in new 
settings to improve outcomes and reduce the 
cost of care. Medtech innovations could support 
this shift. Devices that are less invasive result in 
lower-risk procedures and quicker postoperation 
recoveries. Connected-care ecosystems allow 
caregivers to monitor and communicate with 
patients outside of ICUs. According to McKinsey

largest customer segment, are projected to see 
slower growth than almost all other healthcare 
provider types (Exhibit 3).14

To date, medtech companies, especially non-
large-cap companies, have struggled to engage 
newer sites of care. As these sites continue to 
account for a larger proportion of profitable care, 
medtech companies should work to refine their 
value propositions and commercial operations to 
effectively compete in these segments.

Rethink global growth strategies. Geographic 
strategies have risen to the top of many medtech 
CEO agendas. Many companies that pursued 
global expansion now find themselves with 
unwieldy commercial organizations, complex 
regulatory challenges, and innovation road maps 
with competing regional priorities. Although 

Europe remains the source of innovation for many 
segments, the European Union Medical Device 
Regulation (EU MDR) has introduced new costs, 
such as postlaunch surveillance requirements, 
for companies operating in the region.15 Likewise, 
hospital-level tendering and contracting policies 
are increasing the commercial investment needed 
to serve European healthcare providers. The United 
States and Japan, with expertly trained surgeons 
and care teams on the cutting edge of technology 
adoption, continue to be priority markets, but 
competition is intensifying, requiring new levels of 
innovation and service to effectively compete. China, 
which grew at double the rate of the rest of the 
market before the COVID-19 pandemic,16 offers an 
underpenetrated market of patients and providers. 
However, it also offers unprecedented short-term 
challenges for multinational companies, such as 
increases in volume-based procurement and viable 
local competition.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeCompany leaders should take action to clarify 
their global intentions and tailor their strategies 
to specific geographic regions. This includes 
reassessing commercial models, increasing 
or reducing investment, and considering local 
acquisitions to foster profitable growth. 

Compete intelligently in digital ecosystems. 
Medtech companies have been experimenting 
with digital solutions for more than a decade. In 
many cases, these R&D programs and customer 
pilots have not materialized, leaving executives and 
boardrooms skeptical about the so-called digital 
revolution in medtech. Conversely, companies 
that have cracked the code are changing the care 
paradigm and realizing better outcomes for patients, 
providers, and companies. Digital ecosystems 
that marry capital products with technology are 
reshaping how companies create products, go to 
market, and engage with stakeholders.

Consider the digitalization of the operating 
room. AI-based clinical decision making, fueled 
by device data, has become an integral part of 
many spine and general surgery procedures, and 
patient-monitoring solutions are helping critical-
care caregivers wean patients off life-sustaining 
devices more safely. Some imaging companies are 
generating up to $1 billion a year from data-related 
solutions that improve patient care.17

As the next decade progresses, some executives 
may be tempted to ignore digital opportunities 
because of a history of failed internal attempts. 
Those companies might reconsider, take note of 
other companies’ successes, and collaborate with 
their customers to build winning solutions based 
on lessons from the 2010s.

Commit to investments in execution excellence. 
COVID-19-related supply shortages, drops in the 
number of health system procedures, and hospital 
staffing challenges have introduced uncertainty to 
medtech company operations. Following a decade 
of steady economic growth, one implication of 
this newfound uncertainty is increased scrutiny of 

pilot programs and initiatives. Companies that had 
been experimenting with new commercial models, 
supply chain investments, or digital offerings are 
now facing calls to cut funding to reduce costs. 
Although some medtech companies are reducing 
resources evenly across programs, we are seeing 
that firms have more success when they make 
trade-offs and commit at scale. For instance, 
one company recently considered two ongoing 
investments: one in a new digital offering and one 
in a new, digitally enabled commercial model that 
allows clinical consultants to spend more time with 
care teams. The company made the bold choice 
to shut down the new offering while committing 
to commercial innovation. In addition to providing 
immediate cost savings and accelerating growth, 
the choice has delivered the benefit of clarity, 
aligning the organization’s employees in their 
execution priorities. 

Companies should perform a detailed review 
of ongoing investments and use this period of 
uncertainty to commit to the handful that will drive 
performance in the long term.

Take note of investors’ increased attention to 
margins. Medtech companies created significant 
shareholder value during the 2010s. The industry 
accelerated growth and innovation, propelling 
share price appreciation. As performance 
improved, investors began to “price in” future 
growth improvements, which created additional 
share price gains. The result is a new value-
creation paradigm: in investors’ eyes, companies’ 
chances to beat current growth expectations are 
low, given that the industry has already doubled 
its growth rate in the past ten years. Meanwhile, as 
of the first quarter of 2023, the operating margins 
for medtech companies are 200 to 400 basis 
points lower than they were in 2021, returning to 
mid-2010s levels.18 As a result, although revenue 
growth remains the primary driver of value creation, 
investors are also increasingly paying attention to 
profit margin. Since 2019, the correlation between 
profit margin and medtech valuations has more 
than doubled (Exhibit 4).19

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade 
 
 
R&D and product development excellence are 
foundational for sustainable business growth 
in medtech. Accordingly, the industry invests 
substantially in innovation. At the same time, 
medtech profits are under pressure and demand 
higher productivity and returns from R&D. In this 
environment, R&D excellence is a top priority for 
company leaders. 

In medtech, R&D spending alone is not strongly 
correlated with growth. Instead, our research and 
experience suggest four areas of focus. First, a 
systematic approach to portfolio management 
is prerequisite for any R&D organization to stay 
focused on value-creating innovation. Second, a 
subset of enablers is associated with delivering 
world-class products—namely, empowered 
product managers, deeply embedded design 
thinking, and strong system-engineering 
capabilities. Third, leading R&D organizations 
have effectively adopted agile principles and are 
harnessing next-generation digital and analytical 
tools. Finally, R&D organizations’ outward 
orientation (for example, working with open 
development networks) helps boost their pipelines 
and productivity.

To be sure, acting on and excelling in all these areas 
amounts to a transformational change compared 
to how medtech R&D organizations typically 
operate, but the prize could be a boost in value 
creation and a sustainable competitive advantage.

An innovative industry with 
opportunities to optimize R&D
Prolific innovation occurs in the medtech industry. 
For instance, about 15,000 patent applications 
were filed at the European Patent Office by 
medtech companies in 2021, significantly more 
than by pharmaceutical or biotech companies.

This level of activity comes at a cost: the largest 
global medtech companies invest an average of  
8 percent of their revenue on R&D.1 Other capital-

intense, innovative industries spend much less; 
for example, in the automotive industry, the figure 
stands at just 4 percent of revenues.

But R&D spending and patents alone don’t 
guarantee proportional value creation. Our analysis 
of the 70 largest global medtech companies 
reveals that average R&D spending in the previous 
three years accounted for only about 1.6 percent 
of the variation in companies’ growth rates. In 
fact, the average number of US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approvals per billion dollars 
spent has declined by an average of 9 percent per 
year since 2011 (exhibit).2

Some medtech companies are falling behind in 
R&D productivity and returns, as measured by 
new product approvals. Our survey of 220 industry 
leaders in medtech, advanced electronics, and 
high-tech sheds some light on the challenges.3

First, there are gaps in basic R&D execution. Our 
experience shows that only about 35 percent 
of medtech projects are developed on time and 
on budget. The number sinks further within 
organizations that fail to counter increasing R&D 
complexity by improving R&D maturity and efficiency.

We also find that medtech companies are more likely 
than their counterparts in other industries to lack 
foundational elements, such as adequate staffing 
and proper definitions of project goals. Moreover, 
nearly two-thirds of medtech respondents in this 
survey reported as common occurrences unrealistic 
project timelines and a lack of specific expertise in 
product development teams.

At the same time, the stakes for timely delivery of 
innovation are getting higher: competition is intense 
in many attractive segments, and the order of 
product launches can have considerable impact on 
market shares. Commoditized products are facing 
intensifying price pressure in many markets. Finally, 
patients and physicians are urgently awaiting new 
solutions to diagnose and treat diseases.

outperform their counterparts take a holistic 
approach to R&D transformation. This means 
tackling in parallel five areas that are critical for 
R&D excellence.

A systematic approach to portfolio management
An effective approach to developing and 
managing an R&D portfolio builds a compelling 
road map to growth and bolsters commercial 
performance. Companies with effective R&D 
portfolio management systems share certain 
characteristics. First, they have formalized R&D 
portfolio management processes and a strong 
decision-making culture in which top management 
is deeply committed and engaged. Practically, 
this can mean that global business-unit heads 
and R&D teams review pipelines on a quarterly 
basis. Importantly, determining what not to do is as 
crucial as deciding what to pursue. According to 
our research, the organizations that are the most 
successful in their R&D portfolio management are 
unafraid to terminate projects that fail or struggle 
to advance or those whose business cases have 
weakened due to changes in the market. 

Another marker of best-in-class R&D portfolio 
management is a single centralized and frequently 
updated source of truth for all R&D project data, 
particularly data that feeds into each project’s 

business case and enables the informed and timely 
decision-making described above.

Importantly, R&D performance management does 
not end with the commercialization of a new asset: 
leading R&D teams closely monitor their portfolios 
throughout the life cycle and continuously learn 
from their real-world performance. For example, 
organizations could monitor how a newly launched 
product performs against the expectations that 
were built into its initial business case. This kind 
of feedback can help R&D—and commercial—
organizations to continuously improve the quality 
of their predictions and decision making.

Medtech leaders know these efforts matter to 
investors. A senior executive at one large global 
medtech company told industry analysts that their 
organization doubled the value of the company’s 
pipeline R&D projects and multiplied the number 
of high-value R&D projects (as measured by net 
present values) in three years, clearly displaying 
value creation potential to the public markets.

Three “power capabilities” to define world- 
class products
Delivering world-class products, technologies, 
and services to healthcare providers and patients 
is every R&D organization’s ultimate purpose. To 
achieve this, R&D organizations need to excel in 
three areas.

Medtech companies that outperform 
their counterparts take a holistic 
approach to R&D transformation. This 
means tackling in parallel five areas  
that are critical for R&D excellence.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeProduct management. In practice, this means 
empowering product managers to act as 
business owners for their respective products. 
To fulfill this mission, product managers need to 
have a comprehensive set of skills, particularly 
in leadership and influencing, and a strong 
understanding of unmet customer needs. Ideally, 
they also have sufficient technical knowledge 
to manage product requirements and engage 
effectively with R&D engineers. 

Because such talent is rare, organizations should 
invest in building these skills through in-house 
capability-building programs; strategic hiring 
of experienced product managers from outside, 
including from other industries; and a leadership 
development model that incorporates product 
management into an attractive career path.

Design thinking. Design thinking should be 
systematically applied to every R&D project.4 
Design-thinking methods include closely observing 
healthcare providers and patients, mapping end- 
to-end journeys from the perspective of user 
personas, and rapidly prototyping and iterating 
product concepts in partnership with users. 

In a world in which consumer products set the 
bar for simplicity, performance, and ease of use, 
design thinking is key to developing distinctive 
medtech solutions. It leads to products that 
engage patients and healthcare providers through 
intuitive user interfaces and that offer a seamless 
experience across the user journey—attributes 
that can provide a decisive competitive edge.

Excellence in design correlates strongly with  
value creation: medtech companies that led the 
industry in adopting best design practices had  
42 percent higher revenue growth and 108 percent 
higher shareholder returns compared with the 
average competitor.5 The impact can also be seen 
on an individual product level: Distalmotion, a 

manufacturer of surgical robots, adopted design-
thinking best practices when developing its next-
generation system and achieved a significant 
reduction in development time.6

Systems engineering. Systems engineering 
is an R&D function composed of engineers 
with extensive experience and deep technical 
capabilities. This group is usually responsible 
for new-product concepts, architecture, and 
specifications. A strong system-engineering 
function effectively translates users’ unmet 
needs and requirements into actionable product 
architectures and technical specifications for 
entire systems and their components. Input from 
systems engineers is vital for engineers—including 
mechanical, electrical and electronics, and 
software—who design, verify, validate, produce, 
and launch products.

Agility and speed in product development 
execution
Speeding up product development is paramount 
for most medtech R&D leaders. Agile development 
practices, such as continuous decision making, 
can help increase speed and effectiveness.7 In 
our experience, agile development practices 
are especially influential in the R&D of complex 
systems, where they can reduce time to market by 
more than 30 percent and increased productivity 
by about 20 percent. They generally help 
organizations respond more flexibly to changes 
or new information and reduce risk by providing 
transparency into the status of projects. 

Of note, agile development needs to be applied in 
the unique context of medtech R&D. For example, 
agile processes will need to be tailored to work in 
between the typical stage gates of R&D necessary 
for quality assurance and regulatory compliance. 
Still, they can significantly improve collaboration 
among R&D engineers and between R&D and 
other functions.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeMedtech companies draw the most  
benefit from agile practices when  
used in concert with other core  
agile principles.

The medtech quality process can likewise be 
adapted to agile frameworks. Currently, many 
design control deliverables are still developed 
and documented manually and retroactively, with 
the documents approved in batches in quality-
management systems. Instead, quality could be 
embedded in the development process from the 
outset and tested at each development stage, 
aided by digital tools. These best practices 
have streamlined design controls, allowing 
organizations to cut in half the time it takes to 
generate design history files (DHF), a requirement 
for regulatory approval.

In our experience, medtech companies draw the 
most benefit from agile practices when used in 
concert with other core agile principles, such as 
small cross-functional teams and daily rituals.8 
Finally, basic principles of R&D effectiveness—
for example, allowing a critical number of 
engineers to fully focus on one project at a time 
and investing in project management capability 
building—remain important. 

Next-generation digital and analytical tools
Next-generation digital and analytical tools can 
help R&D functions increase productivity and 
speed in product development and enhance 
the performance and quality of products. These 
technologies have already helped reduce 
development cycle times by more than 50 percent 
and have reduced costs by 30 percent in other 
industries, according to our analysis. 

Medtech companies have begun to adopt these 
tools to boost efficiency. One medical equipment 
R&D organization used to rely primarily on paper, 
needed to be co-located, and took 12 to 18 months  
to develop new products. New software now 
allows the team to create digitized design-
history files that support collaboration on three 
continents, and the team cut its development 
timeline to six months. Another company reduced 
its R&D costs by 10 percent and increased 
throughput by 15 percent by using advanced 
analytics to identify and respond to opportunities 
to improve R&D productivity. For instance, the 
company discovered that it could dramatically 
improve collaboration between functions by 
altering the composition of product development 
teams, with more frequent and direct contact 
between engineering, upstream marketing, and 
supply chain during stage gate handovers.

Digital tools can also enhance the performance and 
quality of medical devices and avoid costly reworks. 
For example, a severe adverse event in a human 
implant was discovered during animal testing. 
The traditional approach to design and validation 
would have delayed the launch by many months. 
But the R&D team used a digital twin (a virtual 
representation of the physical medical device) 
and a deep-learning model to rapidly simulate and 
validate hundreds of potential alternate designs.9 
This approach helped the team quickly converge on 
an improved design that addressed the issue and 
kept the launch on schedule.

organization to compete,” McKinsey, May 25, 2021.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeExternal development 
Unlike their pharmaceutical counterparts, which 
may derive up to 50 percent of their product 
development pipeline from external partners such 
as contract research organizations, medtech 
companies have traditionally focused on in-house 
innovation. But with disruption from fast-moving 
digital players and pressure from low-cost 
providers in commoditized areas, medtech 
companies could consider accessing ideas, talent, 
and technologies from external sources. 

This broad category includes original development 
manufacturers and joint development 
manufacturers. It also includes joint ventures and 
strategic alliances for new businesses, as well as 
corporate venture funds, through which companies 
take equity positions in promising start-ups.

For development efforts that fall outside the 
company’s core businesses and competencies, 
one approach is to spin off the venture, find 
co-investors to scale it, and reintegrate it into the 
parent company later. Among the benefits, the new 
venture—freed from corporate decision making—
can move more quickly, has access to a larger 
pool of capital from investors with a higher-risk 
appetite, and can maintain a strong strategic and 
operational focus (as can the core business).

Medtech companies can get more out of their 
substantial investments in R&D. Rewiring the 
function could help make it not only a source of 
innovation but also an engine for commercial growth.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeSoftware is taking on a new, expanded role in 
medtech. Traditionally, it has performed a basic 
function within a medical device, such as the 
reader of an in vitro diagnostic assay. However, 
more companies are discovering that software 
can be a value-adding differentiator. Consider a 
spinal cord stimulator, which uses personalized 
algorithms to enhance the value of the physical 
device itself. Going even further, some companies 
are proving that software can be the device itself, 
as in the case of Click Therapeutics, whose digital 
therapeutics products treat patients directly. 

As software becomes a more significant source 
of differentiation in medtech, organizations see 
a need to reimagine their product development 
processes. Software development has shorter 
cycles than hardware, necessitating end-to-end 
collaboration across a range of functions. The 
best software products are developed through 
continual interactions with users, allowing 
companies to learn as they go and incorporate 
feedback—a practice not available for hardware 
products. In fact, according to our recent medtech 
R&D roundtable survey, the top constraints for 
software development in medtech are related 
to operating models—team capacity, skills, and 
talent—not technology or demand (Exhibit 1).

In this article, we highlight how medtech companies 
can integrate lessons from leading software 
companies to excel in software development. 

Adapting software R&D operating 
models for success
For medtech incumbents seeking to shift to value-
added software or software as a device itself, we 
suggest three actions to improve their operating 
model: build a robust tech stack, adopt software 
development best practices, and strategically 
source intellectual property and talent. 

Build a robust tech stack
Patients’ very lives may depend on their medical 
devices. Unlike in social media or other digital-first 
industries, end-product failures cannot be tolerated. 
Healthy functionality begins with a robust tech stack 
that enables elasticity (to grow), agility (to innovate 
rapidly), and reliability (to reduce risk).

At a high level, the stack has three layers1: 

The engagement layer is the software’s connection 
to the outside world (other devices and data 
sources). Because medtech software will likely 
need to work with many counterparties, medtech 
companies should focus on building a flexible 
engagement layer that ensures the ability to 
integrate reliably and securely with partners 
through APIs.

A distinctive intelligence layer harnesses 
algorithms (a key source of differentiation) and 
seamlessly aggregates data from proprietary and 
publicly available sources. 

1  In our chapter on ecosystems, we discuss how each layer can add value to patients and clinicians. In this chapter, we highlight where medtech 

companies need to focus to build strong and functional layers.

‘ We’ve been using software for over three decades, but its function was to make 
our instruments run. Now we’re in the business of using software to deliver  
actionable insights, using digital tools and data science in the service of patients  
to drive outcomes. These tools support our core strategy of delivering personalized  
healthcare as well as our next step: adding insights to that combination of 
pharma and diagnostics.’

In many industries, proprietary data can be the 
most critical differentiator, while algorithms can be 
seen as more commoditized. In medtech, data is 
similarly important, but the thinking on algorithms 
differs. Given that algorithms make decisions that 
influence patient care and outcomes, effective 
algorithms can quickly differentiate companies 
from one another. In our experience, medtech 
companies that prioritize algorithms alongside 
data are most likely to achieve better outcomes.

The infrastructure layer has been the focus of 
much innovation over the past ten years, thanks 
to the advent of cloud. The traditional model, 
which required large, onetime investments in data 
centers, has been replaced by consumption-driven 
pricing models that lower barriers to entry.

Although companies often focus on cloud’s 
potential to lower infrastructure costs, the 
true benefits extend further. Global cloud-
services providers (CSPs) have made significant 
investments to develop industry-specific offerings 
and innovate in the engagement and intelligence 
layers. To get the most benefit, medtech 
companies should build a new tech stack tailored 
for the cloud rather than simply retrofit their 
existing tech stack. 

Adopt software development best practices
The good news is that leading software companies 
have established a tried-and-true method for 
developing products in a consistent, efficient 
manner. For medtech companies to adopt this 
method, which differs substantially from their 
standard hardware development processes, 
following several best practices will be crucial.

Rethink product management. Innovative start-
ups excel at responding precisely to the most 
critical unmet needs of customers. They start 
with an idea but then use their product leadership 
muscles to rapidly iterate (with customers, product 
managers, and product developers) to develop and 
deliver the most desired features.

By comparison, product managers within medtech 
organizations often report to regional marketing 
teams and focus largely on gathering requirements. 
Their interactions with R&D often involve rigid, legacy 
documentation of market and product requirements 
rather than more collaborative problem-solving 
sessions. This disconnected structure leads to 
elongated development loops, quality issues, and 
multiple postrelease refinement cycles, which 
increase overall R&D costs and erode value. 

23

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeThe role of product manager at medtech 
companies is often conflated with those of project 
and program managers. Medtech leaders point 
to two characteristics of great product managers. 
First, they carefully track usage data (for example, 
from product telemetry) and draw on it to know 
their customers, shape the product road map, 
determine when to retire products, and enable 
users to capture value more quickly. Active field 
testing and experimentation enable product 
managers to aggregate data that supports the 
product’s continuous improvement. 

Second, great product managers have an 
impeccable “product sense.” Drawing on years of 
experience and a mindset unfettered by norms, 
they have an intuitive ability to understand how 
technology can address an issue in a new way. The 
best product managers tap designers, engineers, 
and data scientists early in the ideation phase to 
benefit from their unconventional thinking.

Promote engineering excellence. Software 
engineering excellence can unlock significant 
value across multiple dimensions. In our 
experience, companies that increase the 
productivity of engineers, teams, and the whole 
organization can save 15 to 30 percent in IT 
operating expenditures, accelerate time to market 
tenfold, and achieve 55 percent higher innovation 
from self-organizing, agile teams. 

For most software-driven companies, engineers 
are the most expensive resource. Therefore, 
development velocity—the ability to achieve 
transformative business performance through 
software development—is critical. A McKinsey 

survey of more than 400 companies found that 
product management, culture, talent management, 
and development tools have the highest impact on 
developer velocity (Exhibit 2).2 However, identifying 
and executing these levers is a difficult challenge. 

To fully unlock velocity and deliver innovation to the 
front lines quickly, companies can act in four phases. 
In the diagnostic phase, companies assess their 
current development velocity using machine learning–
based analysis and benchmarking. In the blueprint 
phase, companies redesign their organizational 
structure and product development life cycle. In the 
frontrunner phase, companies implement a new 
product and engineering model with one to two 
teams and an embedded coach. Finally, during the 
scaling phase, companies systematically scale this 
new way of working to the broader team.

Lead in cybersecurity. Quality and safety 
requirements already play an important role in 
medical devices. For software-based solutions, 
cybersecurity enters the equation. For patients, 
providers, payers, and other ecosystem partners, 
the concept of medtech manufacturers handling 
sensitive patient data is relatively new. Companies 
that develop leading cybersecurity practices and 
prove themselves to be trusted partners could 
therefore gain a competitive advantage.  

Tailor development processes based on 
regulatory needs. In conversations with medtech 
executives, we frequently hear concerns about 
whether their organizations can harness the 
benefits of software product development—
including agility and rapid iterative cycles—in a 
highly regulated industry. 

2 For more on developer velocity, please see Chandra Gnanasambandam, Neha Jindal, Shivam Srivastava, and Dilip Wagle, “Developer Velocity 
at work: Key lessons from industry digital leaders,” McKinsey, February 22, 2021; and Shivam Srivastava, Kartik Trehan, Dilip Wagle, and Jane 
Wang, “Developer Velocity: How software excellence fuels business performance,” McKinsey, April 20, 2020.

‘ Most of our compliance and quality issues emanate from our inability to gather 
nonfunctional requirements. Our [product] teams have never done it. That will not 
work in a software product. Product managers need to know what, when, how, 
where, and everything around it.’

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade‘ Not all software needs to follow the same standards. In a single meeting, we

never thought was possible.’

The companies that have done so most 
successfully have recognized the benefit of 
“branching”: tiering software features within a 
given product and tailoring their development 
accordingly. Highly regulated features follow one 
branch of the development pathway, while less-
regulated features follow another branch. 

the talent gap. This strategy can be effective to a 
point, but it can also cause issues: as contractors 
become a larger portion of the software team, 
companies may experience a shortage of in-house 
strategic capabilities, the loss of a long-term 
product pipeline, higher operational costs, and 
quality issues. 

One large medtech company dedicated three 
months to an “all hands on deck” effort to 
categorize its software products and develop 
tailored branches for each category. Some of the 
most interactive software elements (for example, 
a phone app that shows status and schedule) 
were identified as being subject to less-stringent 
standards. As a result, the company can frequently 
update the user interface based on user feedback 
and still maintain compliance.

Source talent strategically
Medtech companies use advanced recruiting 
capabilities to attract world-class hardware and 
engineering talent. However, companies have 
yet to prove their value proposition and recruiting 
prowess when it comes to software candidates. 

Recently, a council of leading medtech chief 
information officers (CIOs) and chief technology 
officers (CTOs) identified the shortage of 
good technical software talent as the most 
significant inhibitor of growth and innovation for 
their organizations. Successful companies can 
capture substantial benefits, have higher growth 
potential (Exhibit 3), and ultimately deliver better 
patient outcomes.

A company pivoting to a software-focused 
strategy will likely find value in restructuring the 
organization toward a team of in-house talent 
that will enable long-term productivity and 
performance enhancements. Not every company 
will be able to prioritize a wholesale transformation: 
talent is scarce, and speed to market should 
remain a priority over waiting until the organization 
has a fully equipped team in-house. However, 
companies should be aware of these potential risks 
when hiring contingent labor. Companies can map 
their end-state organization and identify which 
roles will be most strategic (more appropriate for 
in-house) and which will be primarily execution 
oriented (more appropriate for contingent). 
Medtech executives can also build relationships 
with staffing companies and other ecosystem 
players to establish a more reliable source for 
contingent team members.

These talent considerations apply not only to 
sofware developers but also to roles in the 
product management, quality, compliance, and 
legal departments. 

Today, medtech companies routinely fill open 
software positions with contingent labor to close 

In the next era of medtech innovation, value will 
be disproportionately skewed toward software. 
Medtech companies have an in-depth understanding

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade 
 
Medical devices have become smaller, lighter, 
safer, and sturdier. Following the lead of other 
technologies—from computers and cell phones 
to cars—the next frontier is to make devices 
smarter. Smart devices form ecosystems, which 
aggregate data, derive insights to improve 
experiences, and create loyalty (to that ecosystem 
over others). In healthcare, ecosystems have 
advanced significantly in recent years,1 thanks 
to improved access to health data (for example, 
through improved electronic-health-record [EHR] 
data interoperability) and an increase in funding in 
healthcare technology.2

To date, large medtech companies have not 
participated at scale in digital health ecosystems. 
Medtech companies’ absence in ecosystems 
comes despite the companies’ two valuable, 
relevant assets: medical devices and the data 
they generate. The previous two chapters explore 
innovation in each asset—devices and software—
on its own. This chapter explores what’s possible 
when companies bring devices and data together 
into device-driven ecosystems.

McKinsey estimates that the total addressable 
market for medtech companies in digital health 
ecosystems will reach $140 billion by 2025, with 
double-digit CAGR. This opportunity is spread 
across five areas: clinical-decision enablement, 
workflow improvement, population health 
monitoring, chronic-condition management, and 
patient engagement. 

The basics of a device-driven digital 
health ecosystem
A device-driven digital health ecosystem is a 
gateway, providing users (patients, clinicians, 
health systems, care coordinators, and payers) 
with access to software-based products and 
services through a single digital platform, 
connected to a device. We define ecosystems 
based on their technology components, the 
companies involved in a variety of roles, and 
whether they are “open” or “closed.” 

Technology components 
As discussed in chapter 3, “Cracking the code of 
software innovation,” ecosystems comprise three 
technology layers: engagement, intelligence, and 
infrastructure (Exhibit 1). Each layer plays a role in 
every ecosystem.

The engagement layer supports flexible 
collaboration with the other devices and sources in 
an ecosystem to curate an end-to-end experience 
for users. The intelligence layer, in which 
companies can develop distinctive algorithms, 
consists of an analytics platform used to extract 
and deploy actionable insights from the data. 
The infrastructure layer, built on a cloud-native 
tech stack and housed in the cloud, includes a 
data platform where data is captured, curated, 
managed, stored, and exchanged. 

Ecosystems frequently involve multiple 
stakeholders. Medtech and health technology 
companies often contribute digital solutions and 
software to the engagement layer (for example, 
patient engagement apps and wearables) and to 
the intelligence layer (such as AI and algorithms 
tied to healthcare data). Technology companies 
often contribute to the infrastructure layer (for 
example, cloud and edge computing), and patients 
and providers are often the primary users who 
contribute to and access the data.

Roles in ecosystems 
Given the complexity of ecosystems and the range 
of available opportunities, medtech leaders will 
need to decide what role their company will play3:

 — Builder. A builder typically plans to construct a 
new ecosystem business to provide diversified 
offerings that constitute a break with tradition. 
Generally, builders have their own strong core 
technology, customers, and data. 

 — Orchestrator. An orchestrator helps connect 
companies in an ecosystem by developing a 
series of strategic partnerships and alliances 
and using digital technology to link them

together, provide products and services, and 
share customers and data. 

 — Participant. Participants provide products and 

services in an ecosystem, acting as a link in a 
value chain connected through alliances and 
partnerships and using partners’ resources and 
capabilities to enhance their business, upgrade 
their products to adapt to ecosystems, and 
better meet user needs.

The choice of what role to play depends on the 
company’s capabilities, ambition, and risk appetite, 
among other considerations. Most medtech 
companies today do not play a role in ecosystems. 
Those that do generally act as participants, such 
as imaging companies whose scans (for example, 
MRIs4) are sent to EHRs and stored digitally for 
easy, compliant access by healthcare providers. 

Playing the participant role can be immensely 
valuable to a company, creating loyalty to that 
company’s device beyond a discrete use and 
offering the opportunity to collect additional data 
and glean new insights. Each step up can multiply 
the value at stake. Two examples show the roles 
medtech companies can play:

 — ResMed. ResMed orchestrates its ecosystem, 
which has helped the company build a leading 
position in sleep apnea. ResMed’s AirSense 
machine connects to its myAir app and provides 
milestone accomplishments and motivation to 
patients, increasing therapy adherence by 17 
percent. AirSense also connects to AirView, a 
provider-facing platform that improves patient 
monitoring through remote diagnostic tools and 
feeds data back to ResMed to better personalize 
care and inform product development.5

plays the builder role with Impella Connect, 
a smartphone app that allows healthcare 
professionals and Abiomed’s clinical support

to sit at their bedside. The ecosystem improves 
patient care by sending notifications when urgent 
care is needed. It also enables collaborative 
patient management between the Abiomed 
support team and clinicians, fostering streamlined 
communication based on real-time data.6

Open and closed ecosystems 
Beyond a company’s role in an ecosystem, the 
value of an ecosystem will also depend on whether 
it is open or closed (see sidebar, “Considerations 
for open and closed ecosystems”).

Open ecosystems. Open ecosystems use 
proprietary data from medtech devices as a source 
of insights, and they integrate and share data and 
insights to and from other devices and systems. 
This multifaceted lens can generate a more

Considerations for open and closed ecosystems

Medtech companies can assess 
their open and closed ecosystem 
opportunities with their device 
portfolios and data types, as well 
as the ecosystem’s raison d’être, in 
mind. For instance, a monitoring 
device may lend itself to an open 
ecosystem when several products 
and data components are required

to get a holistic view of the patient’s

condition and because it would be 
easier to partner than to build out 
each ecosystem component. By 
comparison, when the device and 
data are more self-contained and 
readily accessible from a single 
medtech company, such as in 
cardiac-rhythm management, a 
medtech company could more easily 
build a closed system (see table). 

Each type has challenges. An open 
ecosystem relies on collaboration 
from different partners. Closed 
ecosystems can be difficult to 
maintain because competitors are 
often offered incentives to interject 
their products and services. 

Based on recent ecosystem 
successes, it has become clear 

Open and closed ecosystems vary based on device type and reliance on data.

that the notion of open versus 
closed is not always binary; this 
decision might vary across the 
three technical layers to create 
an optimal structure. This could 
be the case, for example, in an 
open system used to treat sleep 
apnea or radiotherapy (exhibit). In 
the sleep apnea ecosystem, the 
engagement and infrastructure 
layers are open to incorporate the 
required data and insights about 
the patient’s chronic-disease state 
(which requires output from and 
to other devices and systems of 
record, such as an electronic health

record [EHR]), but the analytics, 
which dictate how the patient 
could most benefit from their 
continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) device and associated 
services, could be closed in order 
to generate targeted pull-through 
for the medtech company. In the 
radiotherapy ecosystem, the 
infrastructure layer had to be even 
more open, given the need for third-
party imaging and broader oncology 
system data, but the radiotherapy 
treatment planning and reported 
patient outcomes could be closed to 
enhance both patient value (enabling 

smarter treatment) and the device’s 
real-world evidence generation (more 
comprehensive data). 

The choice between open and closed, 
overall and within each ecosystem 
layer, is the critical design principle 
that medtech companies will need 
to evaluate, depending on their 
product and technological capabilities, 
strategic vision, and the broader group 
of participants. 

Ecosystems can have a varied set of open and closed decisions.

comprehensive view of the patient and the ability 
to grow distinct value for users. A company may 
choose to be a builder, orchestrator, or participant 
in an open ecosystem.

Closed ecosystems. A closed ecosystem is one in 
which users rely exclusively on data and services 
from a company’s device or devices. In certain 
scenarios, this option can deliver unique benefits 
to users (for example, a closed-loop system could 
generate data that is more accurate and insightful) 
and to the medtech company (for example, 
creating a higher likeliness that patients will use 
the company’s device and serving as a source of 
additional data to improve algorithms).

How multiple business models can 
create value
Building ecosystems is an intensive process, and 
they require substantial capital, technology, and 
expertise. As such, getting the business model 
right is critical to ensure medtech companies can 
earn a commensurate return on their investments. 

Companies can typically monetize ecosystems in 
two ways (Exhibit 2):

Stand-alone revenue. This entails charging for a 
portfolio of products separate from the device, 
typically through a subscription-based software 
offering or charging other manufacturers and 
participants for use of the platform to enable  
their solutions.

Pull-through device value. Companies capture 
additional device revenue because the ecosystem 
offers more benefits to users and patients who 
use the device more often and in combination with 
more of a company’s products. 

Whether or not companies can generate stand-
alone software or software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
revenue tied to the ecosystem offering depends 
on the additional value they bring to the ecosystem 
(and care pathway), beyond what is already 
delivered by the primary device. As such, we 
typically see more stand-alone value captured 
when companies expand the services and data

they offer through the ecosystem. Furthermore, 
companies that produce and capture large volumes 
of high-quality data have the best chance to 
monetize their ecosystems. For example, a medtech 
company that built an operating room (OR)–focused 
ecosystem around its devices could have third-
party developers create tools and applications 
to enhance the OR experience and, in turn, could 
receive subscription revenues from developers for 
this access. This type of stand-alone revenue will 
continue to rise in importance as ecosystems and 
their value become further solidified.

How medtech companies can launch or 
advance ecosystem initiatives
Many medtech companies have already built or are 
currently building digital point solutions (to serve a 
discrete purpose) around their devices. To extend 
into full ecosystems, leaders should focus on several 
strategy and operating model considerations:

Define value concretely and connect it to the user’s 
economic model. Understanding the user’s need 
is at the heart of an ecosystem’s value. Aligning the 
digital ecosystem’s economics to user economics 
can drive adoption, and increased use of ecosystem 
devices could generate better patient outcomes 
and lower cost of care. For instance, ecosystem 
users such as healthcare providers could have 
value-based-care models with payers in which they 
earn a portion of cost savings tied to the overall care 
provided or earn higher reimbursement as patient 
outcomes improve. Where possible, companies 
could seek to quantify ecosystem ROI (for example, 
substantiated through peer-reviewed research and 

testimonials from key opinion leaders) and use this 
as the basis for their ecosystem commercial models.

Clarify your company’s role in the ecosystem. 
Builders derive more value in ecosystems than 
orchestrators, who in turn derive more value than 
participants. However, participants still derive 
significantly more value than nonparticipants. 
To capture the opportunity in a timely manner, 
medtech companies need to be realistic about 
their potential. Most medtech companies could 
not act as builders in the near term, but they could 
readily become active participants and gain a 
competitive advantage over nonparticipants.

Create network effects and reinforce value. 
Successful ecosystems generate positive 
reinforcement, both for the users they engage and 
in the value they create. Consider an ecosystem that 
uses patient-reported outcomes to inform clinical-
decision-making tools. As more users engage with 
the ecosystem, more data is generated, which can 
lead to better clinical decisions. This, in turn, entices 
more users into the ecosystem. 

Although the level of transformation required 
by medtech companies to deliver ecosystem 
offerings may seem beyond reach for many, this 
is a new frontier of value worthy of consideration. 
Companies that choose to build, orchestrate, or 
participate actively in these device-driven digital 
ecosystems are well positioned to deliver distinct 
impact to patients and providers and to create new 
value for shareholders.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade 
 
In earnings calls and conference halls, medtech 
companies are being asked—and are asking 
themselves—the same question: When will the 
industry return to prepandemic “normal”? For 
commercial leaders, the answer is likely “never.” 
In the near term, labor shortages, high inflation, 
and unpredictable procedure volumes are 
putting pressure on health systems’ financial 
positions.1 More structurally, after three years 
of digital communication, medtech customers—
including healthcare professionals (HCPs), 
health system procurement departments, and 
health system administrators2—have higher 
expectations of their engagements with 
medtech companies.

Innovating engagement models and offerings is 
decidedly difficult for medtech leaders, especially 
in the face of mounting cost containment 
pressures. With R&D often highly protected and 
gross profit difficult to move, SG&A has been the 
target of many CFO reviews. From 2012 to 2019, 
SG&A spend grew slightly faster than sales at 
major medtech companies, but from 2019 to 2022, 
spend shrank as a percentage of sales for the first 
time since the Great Recession.3

Commercial executives are marshaling their 
resources to increase efficiency, but most have 
not pursued a next-generation transformation of 
the commercial model. In a survey of nearly 1,900 
medtech leaders representing a cross-section 
of business functions, half reported that their 
companies have articulated an intent to invest in 
a new commercial model. Two-thirds said they 
had not laid out a customer-centric vision. Eighty 
percent said they have not yet meaningfully 
provided incentives to leaders to execute on the 
people, processes, and technology required 
to achieve that vision.4 Although the traditional 
commercial model still has a place in many 
product categories, medtech leaders increasingly 
acknowledge that, for most categories, a new 
approach is needed.

Rising medtech customer expectations  
Medtech customers expect new forms of 
engagement and new products from medtech 
companies.

Digital engagement. The consumerization trend 
that has permeated nearly every aspect of daily life 
has extended into B2B healthcare settings. HCPs 
have high expectations for digital, omnichannel 
engagement with medtech companies—a trend 
that began well before the pandemic, intensified 
during it, and is likely to become permanent. 

Medtech leaders have started to respond to this 
trend by augmenting the traditional commercial 
model, which has relied primarily on field 
representatives to sell products and solutions, with 
additional roles and channels to provide seamless, 
convenient, personalized, and on-demand 
engagement. These channels include self-service 
portals, webinars, and social media content.

HCPs’ preference for digital and remote 
interactions with companies has continued to 
grow: more than two-thirds prefer email interaction 
with medtech sales reps today, compared with 
less than half in 2019.5 Severe staff shortages, 
which leave HCPs with even less time for in-person 
interactions with medtech representatives, are 
accelerating this trend.

To be sure, in-person interactions are still required 
(for example, when demonstrating products or 
supporting physicians in using a new device). But 
omnichannel engagement—creating a unified 
customer experience across multiple channels with 
the requisite investments in people, processes, 
and technology—is quickly becoming a necessity 
for medtech companies and is associated with 
improved business performance (Exhibit 1). 

Indeed, HCPs say the experience of interacting 
with sales and customer service is on a par with 
price as a reason to switch suppliers.6 In short,

research shows that medtech customers are 
demanding a modern engagement model.7

Subscription-based offerings. HCPs and 
procurement leaders also have higher 
expectations of digital products and solutions 
from medtech companies. Facing financial 
pressures, health systems are increasingly 
expressing a desire to shift their spending 
away from large capital purchases and toward 
subscription-based, as-a-service (XaaS) 
offerings. One director of pharmacy recently 
stated, “For my next purchase, I am going to do 
everything in my power to not buy any hardware in 
favor of an XaaS contract.” 

Tech companies consistently double to triple their 
valuation multiples by shifting to XaaS products 
and solutions with recurring revenue streams 
via licensing or subscriptions.8 Companies that 
have adopted XaaS models have seen improved 
shareholder value, and capital markets tend to 
reward medtech companies that show strong 
growth of new business models and services.9 As 
a result, more medtech companies are harnessing 
the power of ecosystem selling and capturing 
value beyond core medical products by bringing 
solutions and services to market with XaaS 
models. Radiology companies are leading the 
shift to software solutions, but companies in other 
medtech categories are also making this transition.

Building a new commercial model
Meeting HCPs’ rising expectations by providing 
differentiated experiences that improve 
engagement has been demonstrated to be an 
effective commercial strategy. Medtech companies 
that invested in omnichannel capabilities 
experienced two to three times higher revenue 
growth than their less-advanced industry peers.10 
Beyond revenue growth, medtech companies that 
deliver omnichannel personalized engagement 
could increase their customer satisfaction metrics 
and improve selling efficiency. 

When revamping their commercial models, 
medtech leaders can also keep several 
considerations in mind (Exhibit 2): 

Master the basics
A strong set of foundational capabilities could 
be viewed as a self-funding insurance plan for 
the future. Medtech commercial leaders can 
start by identifying the most strategic customer 
stakeholder groups and their beliefs, motivations, 
unmet needs, and desired buying processes.11 
They can augment this research with data-
backed insights including, for example, claims 
data analysis to estimate procedure volumes at 
different hospitals. 

Based on this analysis, medtech commercial 
leaders could identify their highest-potential 
market opportunities and develop their customer 
segmentation strategies accordingly. This step

includes deciding which parts of the portfolio to 
pursue with in-person (versus inside or digital) 
sales and supporting it with effective account 
planning and executive oversight. 

Additional steps toward foundational capabilities 
include the following: 

 — Widely adopt a customer-relationship-

management (CRM) system for daily use  
by in-person and inside-sales teams to 
holistically understand and address account  
and customer needs.

 — Follow a pricing discipline to ensure that none 
of the hard-earned value identified during 
product and market development leaks during 
commercialization. Implementing tools and 
processes such as dynamic deal scoring12 and 
pricing councils could help companies maintain 
this value-based approach to pricing.  

 — Create a measurement system to monitor 

performance down to the territory and account 
level and identify coaching opportunities. 
Dashboards using real-time data feeds could be 

designed with relevant metrics for different groups, 
from individual sales reps to senior leaders.

Personalize omnichannel engagement
Once a medtech company has laid a stable, 
reliable foundation, leaders can layer on additional 
capabilities to create a true omnichannel 
experience.13 With multiple engagement channels in 
place (inside sales, digital, and in person), it becomes 
important for a medtech company to seamlessly 
put them together and deliver a meaningful 
customer experience (Exhibit 3). This starts 
with a deep understanding of the customer and 
designing journeys that not only align with customer 
preferences but can also be adapted in an agile 
manner based on customer actions and behaviors.

Medtech leaders who have built omnichannel 
models agree that several actions are important: 

Lead from the top, and engage change agents. All the 
transformative technologies and processes that go 
into omnichannel primarily support sales reps and the 
new experiences they help create for their customers. 
Therefore, sales leaders and their teams have an 
integral role to play in leading the transformation.

12  Dynamic deal scoring uses advanced analytics to assess deal quality in real time. When combined with incentives and governance, it could 

empower sales teams and increase deal values.

Strategically choose the starting point and maintain 
focus on it. Work from this point to test and iterate 
new methods of engagement. In a McKinsey-led 
panel discussion at the 2022 AdvaMed Conference, 
commercial leaders identified several moments 
that can act as an impetus to redesign customer 
journeys with omnichannel and that can be tied 
to quantifiable business opportunities. These 
moments include launching a first-in-class product, 
launching a second-to-market product with room 
for growth, enabling procedure innovation (new 
standards of care), and entering a new care setting 
or customer segment.

Assemble a dedicated customer experience group. 
This group can study and identify the optimal 
ways to engage with customers based on their 
day-to-day activities and behaviors (ethnographic 
research) and can measure customer responses 

to various efforts through behavior analysis and by 
eliciting feedback (customer satisfaction surveys).

Shift ways of working. Break down commercial 
silos to design campaigns across brands, 
coordinate channels, and learn along the 
way. A cross-functional campaign team can 
include representatives from digital marketing, 
product marketing, in-person and remote sales, 
commercial operations, and the communications 
and legal departments. Agile sprints could 
be viewed as a forcing mechanism to test and 
iterate tactics in early pilots; next, as journeys are 
validated, they may be scaled to the rest of the 
organization in a way that does not require the 
same agile iteration.  

Build data science capabilities. This is a 
prerequisite for addressing the right customers at

models for a digital-first future.

the right time with the right personalized message 
and offering a relevant, tailored product or solution 
on all channels. Initially, an omnichannel approach 
might be manually operated or rules-based, but over 
time, companies could adopt more sophisticated 
AI and machine-learning models—including digital 
twins14—to glean more predictive and automated 
insights into customer engagement. Data insights 
and model outputs can inform marketing campaigns 
that fill the top of the sales funnel (such as through 
common marketing automation tools). The same 
insights can feed into a user-friendly alert or 
recommendation system, such as a pop-up function 
in the CRM system, that alerts sales reps to a recent 
customer engagement in digital channels and 
prompts an in-person follow up.

Harness the power of ecosystem selling
Creating and capturing value beyond core medical 
products allows executives to further evolve their 
commercial models for a digital-first future. Doing 
so requires advanced commercial capabilities. 
First, pricing capabilities should evolve to support 
XaaS models. This requires pricing XaaS to the 
value it delivers and developing differentiated 
subscription offerings to match varying customer 
needs. Second, the commercial organization needs 
to evolve to include new roles (such as digital talent 

and reps skilled in XaaS selling) supported by new 
structures to motivate contract selling. Last, the 
ecosystem must be underpinned by an expanded 
customer success function to support solution 
adoption and drive stickiness. 

One company recently harnessed the power of 
ecosystem selling by revamping its commercial 
organization and processes. Because the decision 
makers for the company’s XaaS products and 
solutions are fundamentally different from those 
who make decisions for legacy products, the 
company created an overlay sales structure 
and hired teams with experience selling digital 
products and solutions. It then documented new 
processes to clarify internal roles at each stage 
of the customer journey, from lead generation to 
the first demo to implementation. It also created 
a RACI matrix mapped to the entire customer 
journey,15 enabling legacy product and digital 
solution sellers to work collaboratively. As a result 
of these efforts, combined deals tripled in value, 
compared with a legacy product deal or purely 
digital deal. 

In another example, a global leader in specialized 
in vitro diagnostics recently started to develop 
and bring to market digital data, analytics, and

By offering, for instance, algorithmic decision-
support solutions using a machine’s test results in 
an “installation fee plus subscription” model, the 
company can drive commercial growth directly 
through its new digital solution. Moreover, it can 
drive instrument and reagent sales because the 
new solution gives it an edge over competitor 

instruments. In addition, physicians—especially 
those who are less experienced—can use the 
instruments more frequently because the solution 
substantially improves the user experience and 
makes complex results easier to interpret (see

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeConclusion
Building commercial capabilities at the 
foundational, omnichannel, and ecosystem levels 
will take time and organizational conviction. 
Propelling this evolution will require commercial 
leaders to articulate a compelling vision that 
employees throughout the enterprise can 
rally around, find champions who can use their 
influence to continually reinforce the vision, and 

publicly celebrate even small successes to help 
create buy-in and support adoption.  

The three layers offer a commercial model for 
the medtech industry’s next act: foundational 
practices propel resilience, omnichannel keeps 
the customer experience at the center, and 
ecosystem selling is the force multiplier in a 
digitally powered future.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade 
 
 
This chapter is a distillation of the 2023 compendium Reimagining medtech operations: Bridging 
medical innovation to better patient care.1

Without operations groups, the medtech industry 
would consist of thousands of prototypes and 
zero patients treated. Operations functions—from 
procurement of raw materials to final delivery of 
products to end customers—allow an idea in an 
R&D lab to translate to patient impact, at scale.

Medtech operations have recently moved into 
the spotlight. When the COVID-19 pandemic 
suddenly disrupted the global healthcare delivery 
system, manufacturing organizations mobilized 
to more than quintuple the US national stockpile 
of ventilators.2 During raw-material shortages 
in the second half of 2022, medtech companies 
continued to supply healthcare providers with the 
devices they needed to save lives, demonstrating 
their supply chain resilience.3

As medtech companies grow and devices become 
more complex, operations could be a source of 
differentiation. Top companies will scale their 
innovations quickly and supply their products 
and services reliably. Those that struggle will find 
themselves mired in increasing complexity.

Medtech companies can rethink their operations 
in targeted ways to become more reliable, robust, 
and profitable and to deliver better patient care. 
This includes a balanced portfolio of initiatives 
across the operations value chain.

Rebuilding supply chains  
with resilience
To prepare for the future, medtech companies 
can rebuild their supply chains with resilience 
as a new priority. Research from the McKinsey 

Global Institute (MGI) suggests that while supply 
disruptions vary in terms of severity and lead time, 
a shock lasting more than two months occurs 
on average every 3.7 years; within a ten-year 
period, such shocks could cause some medtech 
companies to lose approximately 38 percent of one 
year’s earnings (Exhibit 1).4

Medtech leaders can take a structured approach 
to building supply chain resilience. They can start 
by gaining real-time, end-to-end visibility into the 
supply chain (to the extent possible), including 
suppliers across tiers one, two, and three. They 
can then identify potential vulnerabilities and 
establish mitigation plans. Finally, they can create a 
resilience council to provide governance, regularly 
reassessing risks and stepping in quickly to make 
decisions when the need arises. 

Capturing the full value of 
digitalization and Industry 4.0
Although medtech companies acknowledge the 
value of digital and Industry 4.0, capturing that 
value enterprise-wide remains a challenge. In 
boardrooms throughout the industry, discussions 
about digital solutions often focus on increasing 
commercial efficiency and improving R&D 
productivity (see chapters 2, 4, and 5 of this report). 
In our experience, though, digitalization use cases 
are also plentiful in operations, and the value can 
be substantial even with targeted initiatives that 
don’t require a wholesale transformation. 

A leading medical-device company recently 
digitalized its planning function, investing in real-
time dashboards and building a fresh tech stack

to improve both forecast accuracy and product 
and material visibility. As a result, the company 
realized a 15 percent increase in forecast accuracy 
and recaptured $60 million from inventory 
improvement. Companies with specific challenges 
such as lack of supply chain visibility, excessive 
back-order-supply delays, and inefficient inventory 
management should build targeted, user-friendly 
solutions to address them.

Driving innovation with a design-to-
value approach
Medtech companies should seek to advance 
innovation—and unlock substantial top-line 
and bottom-line value—with a cross-functional, 

customer-centric design-to-value (DtV) approach. 
DtV uses fact-based insights—into what end users and 
patients value in products and how other companies 
design offerings—to inform product design decisions. 
It also uses supplier insights to reduce costs in areas 
including packaging and raw materials.

Although medtech companies have long relied on 
design excellence to meet ever-evolving patient 
needs, the industry has been less mature in using 
design to manage products through their life 
cycle to help ensure supply continuity, maintain 
quality, control cost, reduce portfolio complexity, 
and respond to changing market needs. Our 
experience suggests that applying a structured 
DtV approach could increase margins by 15 to 40 

49

share, and, ultimately, deliver better patient care.

Adopting a value-based approach to 
procurement excellence
Even before the recent spike in inflation, 
procurement had become increasingly important 
for leaders, and more chief procurement officers 
are adopting a value-based approach. Direct 

material costs typically represent about 50 to 70 
percent of total cost of goods sold for medical-
device products, yet procurement maturity varies 
widely. Whereas industries such as consumer 
products and automotive are accustomed to 
intense cost pressures, medtech companies 
have not previously needed to invest in building 
effective procurement processes and capabilities. 
As a result, many companies are still in the early 
phases of procurement maturity (Exhibit 2).5

organizations across industries.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeGiven the scale of the complexity, a 
manufacturing network transformation 
can be the ‘bold move’ that drives  
a step change in gross-profit performance.

However, medtech companies that invest in 
procurement excellence have been able to achieve 
a 10 to 15 percent reduction in external spending 
within 18 to 24 months, with sustained 4 to 5 percent  
year-over-year savings.6

Redesigning the manufacturing and 
distribution network 
Manufacturing networks have become increasingly 
complex. M&A activity, new market access 
requirements (such as those included in the 
European Union Medical Device Regulation), and 
fast-changing global trade dynamics, especially 
between China (as a manufacturing hub) and 
Western nations, have combined with broad 
industry growth to put new pressure on networks. 
Given the scale of the complexity, a manufacturing 
network transformation can be the “bold move” that 
drives a step change in gross-profit performance.

Based on McKinsey experience, successful 
network transformations share a few 
characteristics. First, leaders are highly involved in 
network design to ensure a link to overall business 
strategy. Second, the design and execution teams 
are cross-functional, including manufacturing, 
supply chain, distribution, quality, regulatory, 
R&D, and commercial. Third, the team deploys 

a fact-based but rapid approach to activities 
including aligning on the current state, building 
future scenarios, assessing each one using a 
holistic (not just cost-focused) set of quantitative 
and qualitative selection criteria, and developing 
a detailed implementation plan that highlights 
interdependencies between moves. Last, the team 
is championed by the most senior leaders with 
the authority to make the adjustments that will be 
needed during execution phases. Transformations 
that follow these guidelines have yielded cost 
reductions of 15 to 25 percent while also improving 
service levels and resilience.

Embedding quality into business 
processes
Technological advances have enabled a 
fundamentally new way to ensure quality by 
embedding it into virtually all business processes. 
A “smart quality” framework encompasses 
advanced technologies, modern process design 
techniques, and flexible ways of working (Exhibit 3).  
The framework includes five building blocks, 
each with its own application areas to generate 
value. This smart quality lens has the potential to 
dramatically improve quality assurance processes. 
And new digital and analytics technologies make 
it easier for quality teams to access data from

This shift requires the entire organization to

impose structural quality interventions. In our 
experience, a smart quality system could tangibly

despite recognizing the skills gap, fewer than 
half of respondents said they had plans in place 
to address it. A well-designed and thoughtfully

sustainable impact from all other initiatives.

Committing

The medtech industry has long delivered a 
positive impact to patients, communities, and the 
world at large through innovative devices. Now, 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
considerations offer medtech companies the 
opportunity to expand their salutary influence 
beyond the scope of devices. Over the past few 
years, ESG has meaningfully affected medtech 
stakeholders and business outcomes: 

 — Investors. ESG funds own anywhere from 1 to 
12 percent of outstanding shares of the top 30 
medtech companies by market cap.1 Multiple 
equity analysts now quantify ESG performance 
in their price targets: for example, Societe 
Generale rewards top-tier ESG performers with 
a weighted average cost of capital that is up to 
0.6 percentage points better than that offered to 
bottom-tier performers (using their definitions).2 

 — Customers. At hospitals such as the Karolinska 

environmental commitments when deciding 
where to work.9 Likewise, promoting equity in 
the workplace—for example, with clear value 
propositions for different employee cohorts—
could help stem attrition (which is rising, 
especially among women and people of color) 
and improve corporate performance.10

Despite this evidence of ESG’s expanded influence 
on financial performance, its scope is still limited. 
For instance, ESG funds still account for a minority 
of investments, and ESG scores remain a minority 
decision factor in most hospital tenders, especially 
in the United States. As interest rates have risen 
and medtech valuation multiples have declined, 
many executives are considering two questions: 
Will ESG’s influence in stakeholder decision 
making continue to increase? And where should 
we focus our ESG efforts to maximize our impact 
on humanity and business outcomes? 

University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, tenders 
have assigned as much as 35 percent of the 
purchasing decision to ESG criteria.3 In England, 
the National Health Service (NHS) committed to 
net-zero emissions by 2045 with respect to goods 
and services from suppliers.4 And in Germany,  
ESG criteria have been present on as many as  
55 percent of tenders in the last five years.5 

Stakeholders overwhelmingly answer the first 
question affirmatively, though medtech leaders 
will still need to closely monitor ESG targets, paths, 
and progress. For instance, although the NHS net-
zero target date isn’t until 2045, companies should 
track how the NHS plans to sequence its journey—
including, for example, when buying requirements 
will become more stringent. 

 — Regulators. The European Union has enacted 
regulations mandating corporate reporting on 
climate and environmental risk.6 The US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering 
updating its guidance for the Breakthrough 
Devices Program to reduce disparities in health 
and healthcare.7 And the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed 
climate disclosure rules.8 

 — Employees. In the United States, 58 percent 

of employees consider a company’s social and 

In response to the second question, companies 
should consider ESG as a new vector for 
differentiation in commoditized device categories. 
Hospital buyers and device manufacturers 
attribute ESG’s limited influence thus far in tender 
processes to a lack of differentiation among 
medtech devices. Consider a medtech or hospital 
supplies category in which clinical outcomes 
among devices are similar. To differentiate 
themselves in an otherwise crowded tender 
process, companies could invest in product 
teardowns and ESG-friendly rebuilds or generate

quantitative approach to achieve the targets, and 
many face execution challenges. 

ESG performance starts with clear 
objectives
For companies to achieve business impact with ESG, 
investments must start soon. ESG initiatives can 
take many years to implement and deliver results, 
especially considering lead times in manufacturing, 
cross-industry competition for green materials, 
and the challenge of capability building. Given this, 
medtechs should choose ESG areas in which they 
can have the most impact. Our research suggests 
focusing on three objectives in the near term:

Achieve net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions  
and reduce waste along the value chain
For most industrialized nations, healthcare 
systems account for close to 10 percent of national 
greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions—a higher 
proportion than either the aviation or shipping 
industry.11 If the global healthcare sector were a 
country, it would be the fifth-largest GHG emitter 
on the planet.12

From 2020 to 2022, the number of medtech 
companies that set science-based targets for 
emissions reductions (a best-practice step) rose 
sharply (Exhibit 1). Despite more organizations 
setting targets, however, few companies have 
identified a clearly defined, qualitative and 

A first step for companies is creating a marginal 
abatement cost curve (MACC) (Exhibit 2). The 
MACC provides a top-down view of potential 
investments in decarbonization levers (for example, 
product packaging redesign, use of clean transport, 
and use of renewable power) that could reduce 
an organization’s emissions. The MACC ranks 
decarbonization levers in ascending order of 
cost per metric ton of abated carbon to enable 
companies to prioritize the levers to be implemented. 
The MACC also quantifies unabated emissions that 
will need to be addressed through new technical, 
strategic, and market opportunities. 

The next step is to address the biggest 
opportunities identified in the abatement 
curve. Many companies pursue environmental 
improvements in three areas:

Design products and packaging for sustainability. 
Up to 80 percent of a product’s resource footprint 
is established in the R&D phase. The industry is 
exploring numerous compelling ideas to improve 
sustainability. For example, companies are seeking 
to increase use of postconsumer resin (also called 
postconsumer recycled) plastics and to evaluate 
alternative materials for Class I and Class II13 medical 
devices. They are also expanding efforts to 
reduce weight (so-called lightweighting), eliminate

disassembly (to facilitate the recycling of parts), 
thereby simultaneously reducing cost and carbon.

Decarbonize Scope 3 emissions through supplier 
collaboration and development of new materials. 
Scopes 1, 2, and 3 are categories of carbon emissions 
that a company creates.14 Scope 3 emissions are 
not directly in medtech companies’ control, yet 
they account for 60 to 70 percent of total industry 
emissions.15 Achieving targets for reducing Scope 
3 GHG emissions will necessitate engaging with 
upstream suppliers (and their tier-n suppliers).

The value, however, comes not only in reducing 
emissions but also in adopting circular business 
models. Based on McKinsey analysis, about 15 to  
25 percent of emissions could be abated with 

actions that have a positive net present value. These 
actions include addressing product packaging, 
reducing use of plastics containing acrylonitrile 
butadiene styrene, buying zero-carbon aluminum, 
instituting closed-loop recycling, switching to  
100 percent recycled cardboard, and using battery-
powered electric vehicles (BEVs) for transport.

Build capabilities in marketing and sales. Steps 
to achieve this objective include implementing a  
data collection, management, and reporting 
system to readily access sustainability data for 
use in responding to tenders; helping marketers 
incorporate the environmental impact of products 
into customer value propositions; and upskilling sales 
teams to facilitate sustainability discussions while 
building relationships and introducing new products.

Address health inequities by maximizing device 
access to reduce disease burden
Despite continued advancements in healthcare, 
health inequities exist and can manifest in a variety of 
ways: limited access to care for patients; innovation 
efforts insufficiently aligned with the global burden 
of disease; and underserved communities in which 
health systems fail to engage subpopulations 
commensurate with need, to name a few.

For example, there is a significant mismatch 
between commercially available devices and 
disease burden in low- and middle-income 

countries (LMICs). By 2030, noncommunicable 
diseases (NCDs) may be responsible for five times 
more deaths than infectious diseases in LMICs, 
yet less than 15 percent of commercially available 
devices address NCDs in these regions.16

The problem is not only geographical; it can also 
be reflected in our devices. For example, a study 
of racial bias in pulse oximetry in the United States 
found that pulse oximetry devices failed to detect 
occult hypoxemia in Black patients three times more 
frequently than in White patients, therefore putting 
Black patients at greater risk of misdiagnosis.17

countries,” Globalization and Health, July 2018, Volume 14, Number 65.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeLeading medtech companies are making public 
commitments that reflect their social-impact 
aspirations and are implementing health equity 
strategies primarily in two areas:

Democratizing access and affordability of 
products to reach new and diverse markets. 
Medtech leaders are taking proactive steps to 
ensure their devices are accessible to end users 
across diverse geographies and demographics in 
developed and developing markets. This begins with 
developing a holistic, data-driven understanding of 
care delivery globally and within specific markets 
and improving parity at each step of the care 
journey—from closing the gap in misdiagnosis 
and late diagnosis to designing novel solutions to 
improve affordability and expand access.

Embedding health equity into pipeline development. 
Unmet needs can differ at the subpopulation level. 
Leading medtech companies are factoring these 
unmet needs into pipeline development strategies 
and designing and testing products in a manner that 
addresses the diverse needs and preferences of the 
patients and healthcare personnel that use them. 
These considerations typically include ethnicity,  

age, gender, height, weight, pathological background, 
socioeconomics, geography, language, and 
accessibility. Additionally, companies should consider 
tailoring product development to conditions in 
markets with more fragile or incomplete supply chains.

Promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in  
the workplace
Increasingly, we find that the most diverse 
companies recognize diversity, equity, and inclusion 
(DEI) as more than a social-justice imperative; they 
also see it as a core enabler of growth and value 
creation. These diversity leaders are pulling ahead 
of the rest, and they are more likely to financially 
outperform their peers (that is, companies in the 
top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams 
were 25 percent more likely to have above-average 
profitability than companies in the bottom quartile).18

Medtech companies have made improvements 
in DEI, but women and minorities are still 
underrepresented compared with other industries. 
Although the life sciences industry has been 
successful in attracting women at the entry level, 
representation drops off sharply in the pipeline to 
senior leadership (Exhibit 3). Women in medtech

only 28 percent of C-suite leaders.19 The medtech 
industry also faces a lack of racial diversity: Black 
people account for just 3 percent of those in medtech 
leadership roles in the United States20 despite 
making up more than 13 percent of the population.21

Progress toward achieving diversity goals requires 
a systematic business-led approach and bold, 
concerted action toward inclusion.22

from ESG. Companies should use a four-step 
approach to guide their ESG journey:

Understand the relevant ESG context. This entails 
achieving a thorough understanding of the full scope 
of the company’s (positive and negative) ESG-relevant 
activities, the material sustainability topics in the sector, 
what competitors are doing, and what matters to 
stakeholders. This analysis can help the company 
identify its “superpowers” and vulnerabilities.

A business-led approach to DEI. Leading 
companies are taking a systematic approach to 
DEI, including setting quantitative goals to diversify 
their workforces and ensure their organizations 
reflect the diversity of the communities in which they 
operate. Best-in-class medtech diversity leaders, for 
example, have committed to placing women in 45 
percent or more—and people from ethnically diverse 
groups in the United States in 30 percent or more—
management positions globally within five years. 

Taking bold steps to strengthen inclusion. 
Addressing inclusion requires an organization to 
enable equity of opportunity through fairness and 
transparency; promote openness by tackling bias 
and discrimination; and foster belonging through 
support for all kinds of diversity. Sponsors and 
allies play a critical role alongside policies and 
programs in advancing and retaining diverse 
talent. This will be important for a company’s value 
proposition to prospective and current employees.

An ESG plan helps bring the  
ambition to life
Delivering on ESG ambitions can be challenging, 
but first movers could be rewarded.23 Although 
many leaders consider ESG a priority, most 
organizations face risks from poor execution or 
don’t have a robust plan to enable value creation 

Define the company’s contribution. Set 
sustainability goals and prioritize sources of 
differentiation from competitors. Develop a 
go-forward sustainability strategy, including 
themes and priority initiatives. Determine KPIs, 
and set quantifiable targets.

Engage broadly. Develop stakeholder engagement 
and communications plans; integrate ESG into 
the investor relations strategy; and establish a 
reporting strategy and cadence.

Sustain the ESG commitment. Implement an ESG 
program broadly by rolling out ESG initiatives tied 
to themes. Ensure the organization, incentives, and 
operating model are set up to deliver on the ESG 
ambition, and continually track progress and impact.

Moving forward, medtech leaders will likely view 
ESG in one of two ways: either as a set of far-off 
compliance regulations that their companies 
will need to follow one day or as an opportunity 
to create new positive impact for companies, 
communities, and shareholders and as a source 
of differentiation. Only by taking a systematic 
approach and adopting a clear path forward can 
medtech companies ensure that they maximize the 
value creation opportunity with ESG.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade 
 
 
A decade of growth acceleration has paradoxically 
left medtech companies in a difficult position. The 
industry has grown by 50 percent since 2012,1 
making it harder for companies—particularly larger 
ones—to organically improve their performance. 
This presents a challenge for companies eager 
to create value in an industry that has not 
outperformed the public market since 2019.

M&A—mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures—can 
reliably and rapidly improve a company’s performance 
outlook. M&A can help organizations serve more 
patients in more ways, enabling them to access 
new patient pools, scale for better commercial 
operations, divest distracting and underfunded 
businesses, and add new capabilities in digital or R&D.

But reconfiguring a corporate portfolio is a 
daunting task. Companies eyeing M&A will 
have to negotiate overarching macroeconomic 
uncertainties and tightening capital markets. 
Notably, earnings growth—rather than simply 
top-line growth—is increasingly important to 

company valuations.2 (See chapter 1, “Medtech’s 
value-creation imperative.”) This shrinks the pool of 
attractive potential targets to companies that have 
the right combination of growth and profitability.

In this context, medtech companies can adjust their 
approach to M&A. They can reconsider the value of 
large deals, adjust their priorities in programmatic M&A, 
increase investments in early-stage companies, and 
proactively pursue divestitures. Medtech companies 
that do these things well could fast-track value creation.

A promising environment for M&A 
Despite macroeconomic volatility, market 
conditions for medtech M&A are positive. First, 
prospective acquisitions are getting cheaper after 
years of ballooning valuations. Valuations for the 
highest-growth targets have retreated to their 
lowest point since 2018 (Exhibit 1).

Conversely, divesting companies are likely to attract 
many willing buyers in both private and public equity

markets because of a sedate IPO market. Only five 
medtech companies debuted in the public markets 
in 2022, compared with 23 per year, on average, in 
each of the five previous years.3

profitability (or the ability to increase it) has 
risen in importance to prospective buyers. (For 
more, see chapter 1, “Medtech’s value-creation 
imperative.)

To be sure, the specter of a recession may 
dampen M&A activity: medtech M&A dropped 
by 20 percent during the recessions of 2001 
and 2008,4 and US interest rates now sit at 
their highest level in 15 years.5 However, these 
factors are not the same barriers they may have 
been in the past. Recent McKinsey research 
shows that fewer than 10 percent of medtech 
CEO respondents would defer M&A because of 
a recession. In addition, the 30 largest medtech 
companies currently hold more than $200 billion 
of dry powder in cash or cash equivalents.6

McKinsey analysis of the 125 largest US- and 
EU-based medtech companies by market 
capitalization shows that weighing profitability 
more heavily culls the number of viable targets 
(Exhibit 2).

More than half of the companies (65) boast high 
growth rates in addition to significant revenue 
bases, but less than a quarter (27) are high growth 
and offer potentially accretive margins. Capping 
the size of the target at $20 billion shrinks the 
hypothetical target list to 20.8

Despite the likely high demand for M&A activity, 
willing buyers may discover that the supply of 
attractive assets is lower than they had imagined. 
This is a recent change and is driven by a new 
equation for value creation; margin expansion is 
now more than twice as important to company 
valuations as it was in 2019.7 As a result, 

A shift toward profitability and 
selectivity in medtech M&A
Medtech companies can continue to use M&A as a 
tool to create value; however, decision makers should 
adjust their approaches to potential transactions.

Reconsidering the value of large deals
McKinsey research has shown that big deals 
have also historically involved big bets and big 
risks. They offer significant upside potential but 
with a risk of distraction, customer confusion, and 
slowing revenue growth.9 In an environment that 
rewarded organic growth more, large transactions 
seemed less appealing than simply growing the 
existing business. 

But two factors may change the importance and 
role of large deals. First is the rising importance 
of margin improvement relative to valuations. 
Large deals can provide scale, which can improve 
companies’ cost positions: the 20 largest medtech 
companies by revenue boast a median EBITDA 
margin of nearly 11 points more than the next 
largest 20.10 Companies can especially benefit 
when a particular geography or business unit 
is underperforming on profits, with the merged 
business offering an opportunity for new scale, 
capabilities, and cost synergies.

The second factor is the evolving relationship 
between medtech companies and their customers. 
Because of the increasing adoption of value-
based care and the rise of new digital ecosystems 
(see chapter 4, “Bringing hardware and software 
together into digital health ecosystems”), health 
systems consider medtech companies to be end-
to-end partners rather than simply providers of 
devices. Large deals can help medtech companies 
integrate offerings across portfolios, making it 
more likely that a health system will designate a 
medtech company as a partner of choice. 

Although the higher cost of debt may hamper bigger 
deals in the near term, more companies should 
consider these opportunities as a way to respond 
to new conditions in the industry. Indeed, some 
medtechs have already taken action. Two midsize 
orthopedics companies recently merged, in part to 
use their newfound scale to provide higher service 
levels to customers. Done right, such M&A deals 
could transform companies, improve their ability to

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadepartner with customers, and create cost efficiencies 
that facilitate value creation.

More-selective targeting in programmatic M&A
Programmatic M&A—to achieve specific corporate 
objectives through a strategic series of deals—is 
evergreen.11 As approaches to value creation shift, 
prospective buyers should be more selective.

ecosystems. M&A can help companies transform 
their digital innovation prospects and “short-
circuit” yearslong development cycles. Consider 
Stryker’s acquisition of Vocera in 2022 and GE 
HealthCare’s 2023 announcement to acquire 
Caption Health; both deals will help the acquiring 
companies expand their value propositions beyond 
the benefits of their physical products.

Of course, though margins have become more 
important, innovation will continue to be paramount 
for value creation. In acquisitions that target 
specific innovations or new capabilities, acquiring 
companies will likely want to prepare strategies 
that mitigate potential margin dilution. Growth-
focused acquisitions that expand the core might 
also be more valuable than those that help the 
parent company access adjacencies. Consider how 
the public markets reacted favorably to a 2023 
programmatic acquisition in AI imaging equipment 
and software that boosted the combined entity’s 
growth trajectory and its ability to use its scale to 
forge and maintain customer relationships.

More capital dedicated to digital offerings 
In earlier chapters, we discuss the momentum of 
software innovation and the value of digital health 

More-creative transaction structures 
As profitability and cash management continue 
to gain importance, companies will likely explore 
transaction types outside of traditional M&A or 
divestitures—including co-acquiring companies 
alongside private equity firms or raising external 
capital to fund R&D programs—in exchange for 
product royalties. These deal structures offer a 
lower-risk way for companies to participate in M&A 
or innovation, reducing their own profit-and-loss or 
capital constraints by sharing costs with or shifting 
them to outside partners. For M&A, companies 
can increasingly select this option if the cost of 
debt proves to be too much of an impediment. For 
R&D, companies should consider external capital 
as a way to fund programs or studies that would 
otherwise not receive sufficient funding from 
internal sources. These types of deal structures

Though margins have become more

are increasingly common in the pharmaceutical 
sector. For example, Royalty Pharma has made 
15 investments since the beginning of 2021.12 In 
medtech, Blackstone Life Sciences announced a 
$337 million product investment in Medtronic to 
expand development of diabetes technologies.13

More divestitures
As the medtech industry has grown over the past 
decade, many companies now find their portfolios 
large, diverse, and unwieldy. Compared with the 
assets of a smaller company, a large portfolio 
size makes it more difficult for these companies 

to find strategic moves that materially alter their 
trajectories. A company with $10 billion in annual 
sales would need to generate $500 million to 
$600 million of new revenue and $100 million to 
$180 million of new profit—equivalent to creating a 
new midsize medtech business every year—just to 
keep pace with market growth. 

Divestitures allow companies to adjust their 
portfolios and reset the valuation trajectory for 
the remaining company and the divested business 
unit, which may have received insufficient funding 
and attention under its former parent. Divestitures

dedicate leadership attention and resources 
to their own performance. The proceeds from 
divestitures can also fund potential acquisitions 
or growth initiatives, allowing the company to 
forgo the need to raise the now more-expensive 
debt. Divestitures are already on the rise. In 2022, 
medtech companies sold off almost three times 
as much business (as measured by value) as they 
had in 2019 (Exhibit 3). The trend does not show 

signs of slowing: three of the top 15 medtechs have 
announced plans to divest businesses worth more 
than $9 billion in revenue as of May 2023.

Medtechs’ challenges with value creation amid 
current economic conditions suggest that an 
acceleration in M&A could be beneficial. Leaders 
should explore possibilities—and act—while the 
pool of growing and profitable assets and keen 
buyers is still relatively plentiful.

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decade 
 
 
Many medtech multinational companies (MNCs) 
have established leading positions China—the 
second-largest and fastest-growing medtech market 
globally—by introducing a steady stream of new 
products and continually raising clinical standards. 
For some MNCs, China has become a top contributor 
to their overall growth. Today, the five largest medtech 
MNCs generate an aggregate 10 to 15 percent  
of their global revenue from China.1 Leaders have 
also invested heavily in localized operations and 
supply chains. For instance, one large global medical-
imaging company’s four factories in China produce 
40 percent of its global ultrasound units and more 
than half of its CT and MRI equipment.2

The stakes in China are high for medtech MNCs, 
and the market demands leadership attention; 
however, the growth path has become more 
complex and challenging. First, an increasingly 
multipolar world requires companies to reconfigure 
their global business footprints.3 Second, in China 
specifically, companies are facing escalating 
pressure in pricing and reimbursement, pressure 
to localize sourcing and production, and an 
increasingly competitive local medtech industry.

These considerations are daunting for medtech 
MNC senior leaders, but China is still a market 
with sizable opportunities. It will not only 
continue to contribute to global growth but also 
remain a critical point of access to innovation, 
manufacturing capabilities, and local capital, all 
of which can help fuel the continued growth of 
medtech MNCs.

MNCs should develop new value chain capabilities 
to explore new business models, advance 
commercial and operational excellence, and boost 
resilience. These actions will take substantial effort 
for medtech companies, but they are nonetheless 
essential to address current challenges and 
capture future opportunities.

An increasingly fraught path for 
medtech companies
Commercial pressures are mounting for medtech 
MNCs operating in China because of a variety  
of factors. 

Volume-based procurement (VBP). VBP, aimed at 
lowering unit prices through centralized tendering,4 
is becoming common for medical consumables and 
in vitro diagnosis (IVD) products.5

Although VBP had previously been focused on 
high-spend, reimbursable categories, it has now 
expanded into noncritical care products such as 
dental implants.6 VBP tenders based on provincial 
alliances are further boosting purchasers’ efficiency 
and bargaining power in parallel with national VBP.7

These tenders pose a threat to MNCs’ traditional 
business models and growth strategies. A review 
of past VBP tenders at the province, multiprovince, 
and national levels shows that they have reduced 
prices in hospitals by 50 to 90 percent.8 Accurately 
anticipating the rollout of VBP has been difficult, 
and informed business planning has accordingly 
been more challenging since the inception of VBP.

New reimbursement schemes. These schemes—for 
diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and diagnosis 
intervention packages (DIPs) for inpatient services, for 
example—are likely to result in additional changes in 
hospital spending behavior. According to government 
plans, DRGs and DIPs will be implemented in all 
hospitals and cover 70 percent of basic medical 
insurance spending by 2025.9 Under these schemes, 
hospitals are more likely to choose lower-priced 
products to control costs.

Localization pressure. Pressure from Chinese 
government authorities to localize in China 
threatens MNCs’ positions. The Made in China 
2025 industrial policy and the dual-circulation

strategy are both aimed at advancing domestic 
manufacturing capabilities in high-tech, high-value 
industries, including medtech.10 A growing number 
of government entities of different levels have 
heeded guidance encouraging the purchase of 
locally made equipment and consumables.

Local competition. Competition from China-based 
medtech companies continues to intensify. With 
their entrepreneurial energy, funding, agility, 
and knowledge of the local market, China’s 
domestic medtech companies are accelerating 
launches, expanding and upgrading their portfolios, 
and issuing fast-follower products to MNCs’ 
offerings. For instance, several categories, such 
as transcatheter aortic valve replacements, were 
launched first in China by local companies.11 More 
than 20 local IVD players are currently introducing 
laboratory automation systems to the market.12 
Local purchasing priorities give local companies 
opportunities in categories in which MNCs lack 
local manufacturing. As a result, local companies 
have gradually developed brand recognition and 
captured market share across categories. Chinese 
medtech companies’ market share has surpassed 
50 percent for products in categories such as 
medical imaging and many types of orthopedic and 
cardiovascular devices.13 Moreover, having gained 
scale and experience in their home market, these 

companies are now looking to expand beyond China, 
bringing more competition to global markets.

China remains an attractive market 
and is critical for global success
Many general managers (GMs) of medtech MNCs’ 
China businesses remain confident about the 
opportunities in China. A recent McKinsey survey 
of 20 medtech GMs revealed that these in-country 
medtech leaders expect quick postpandemic recovery 
and solid growth in the high single digits for their China 
businesses in the next few years. Fourteen of the  
20 also expect continued investments into China 
from their parent company. None reported plans to 
scale back their China businesses.

To senior executives based out of their companies’ 
global headquarters, these China GMs’ predictions 
of growth and investments may seem optimistic. 
In reality, some parts of the market may no longer 
be commercially sustainable for all participants. 
On the other hand, China will continue to be a 
major source of global growth. It remains the 
second-largest and fastest-growing market for 
medtech, and the central government has a strong 
imperative to support the healthcare industry. 
Planned healthcare expenditures are projected 
to grow from $1 trillion in 2020 to a “Healthy

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadeChina 2030” goal of $2.4 trillion.14 Based on 
underlying factors such as demographic shifts and 
urbanization, China’s medtech market will likely 
grow at a 5 to 10 percent CAGR and double from 
about $70 billion in 2021 to $110 billion to $165 
billion by 2030 (Exhibit 1). 

An ongoing presence in China will also be essential 
for MNCs to secure access to innovation and 
manufacturing capabilities. Local companies are 
not only launching fast-follower products but 
also producing and commercializing research 
breakthroughs, sometimes on a global stage. 
For instance, one Chinese medtech company’s 
noninvasive bladder cancer test gained a 
breakthrough device designation from the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021.15 In 
manufacturing, a mature and deep local supply 
chain—from raw materials to complex components 
and skilled labor—provides a robust ecosystem for 
medical device development.

And then there is capital. Capital in China can 
cofund growth. Consider that the number of 
private equity and venture capital investments in 
medtech in Greater China grew from about 200 in 

2017 to 330 in 2021.16 Cumulative deal value more 
than quadrupled, from about $772.0 million in 2017 
to about $3.4 billion in 2021 (Exhibit 2).17 The total 
market capitalization of publicly listed Chinese 
medtech companies reached $355 billion in 2022. 
At the same time, transaction volume dipped in 
2022 because of COVID-19, leaving more dry 
powder to spend in 2023.

Succeeding as an MNC in China  
in the future
Many medtech MNCs are in the process of 
reviewing their strategic options in China. They 
should start by asking two questions: What are 
the stakes in China for the global business? And 
how well is the business positioned to succeed in 
China in the future?

Explicitly or implicitly, the answers to these 
questions have guided MNCs’ distinct strategic 
approaches in the Chinese medtech market. Now, 
they can inform MNCs’ future choices. (For an 
overview of possible approaches, see sidebar, 
“Four courses of action for MNCs to define their 
strategic posture in China.”)

Four courses of action for MNCs to define their strategic posture in China

Multinational companies (MNCs) 
can evaluate their current value 
at stake in China and how their 
strengths stack up against the 
competitive environment—their 
right to win in the market. 
Companies can expect to fall into 
one of four archetypes, each with a 
distinct set of options (exhibit).

Selectively accelerating—such 
as adopting an asset-light model 
to expand business in China in 
attractive segments or focusing on 
a part of the global portfolio that 
is competitive in China, potentially 
including developing China-specific

offerings. One consumer-facing 
MNC focuses its investments 
in China on flagship locations 
and e-commerce while using 
distributors to expand the rest of  
its footprint.

Renewing commitments—such 
as expanding the value of the 
company’s global business model 
in China, with local adaptations. For 
instance, some MNCs localize their 
production in China and may even 
localize the majority of their value 
chains to compete the way Chinese 
companies do. A large high-value 
consumables company is investing 

tens of millions of dollars in a fourth 
manufacturing base in China to 
produce its core portfolio. 

Reducing stakes—such as selling 
parts (often a large part) of a 
company’s China business to local 
companies or investors.

Diversifying—such as hedging 
supply chain risks to build resilience 
outside China. For instance, some 
companies manufacture in an 
alternate locale in addition to China. 
Others may shift their operations to 
focus on high-value segments.

Multinational companies in China can evaluate themselves along two 
dimensions.

Companies that have built sizable businesses in 
China in line with its market potential will likely 
choose to renew their commitments. Doing so 
involves strengthening and expanding local 
value-chain capabilities, exploring new business 
models for China, and pursuing commercial and 
operational efficiencies. 

However, many companies—for at least portions 
of their portfolios and operations—may need more 
nuanced strategies. These companies would need 
to evaluate the viability of their product offerings 

and the related commercial models and make 
deliberate choices about where to allocate or 
withdraw their finite resources.

To be sure, this kind of strategic decision making is 
difficult, partly because of the fast-moving market 
context. It’s also difficult because many leaders 
have had decades of experience with China as a 
reliable all-around growth market. Adjusting to and 
communicating objectively about each business’s 
updated strategy in China and the rationale behind 
it will likely take time and require thoughtful  

76

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadefact-based and trusting conversations between 
global and local leadership.

A fresh look at value creation  
in China
As medtech MNCs revisit their China strategies, 
they are striving to achieve a balance that allows 
them to tap into current and future opportunities 
while managing uncertainties that are hard to 
quantify. Often, this boils down to the questions 
of how local the organization needs to become 
across the value chain to succeed and whether 
that degree of localization is feasible and desirable 
from the parent company’s overall viewpoint. 

Five questions can help leaders frame a holistic 
discussion on China while opening the aperture 
beyond traditional strategic moves.

How interdependent is China and the  
global business?
China’s contributions to a medtech MNC’s 
revenues and profits can be readily quantified. 
However, deeper analyses often reveal less 
obvious interdependencies. For instance, one 
medtech company analyzed the effect of product 
volumes destined for the China market on cost 
of goods sold (COGS). It found that without the 
China volumes, COGS of some products would 
increase by as much as one-third, adversely 
affecting competitiveness and profitability far 
beyond China. Many companies will find their 
supply chains deeply intertwined with China-
based manufacturing sites—and even more so 
with Chinese suppliers of intermediate goods and 
products. Mapping out the streams of value and 
goods is a prerequisite to an informed strategic 
discussion on China, and it demands dedicated 
analytical effort for most medtech companies.

Which portfolios actually create value in China?
VBP has catapulted some product categories into 
commoditization; the attractiveness of others has 
been steadily eroded by local competition. Sharp 
reprioritization of portfolios is likely in order, but 
deciding what to let go is often a difficult decision. 
Local organizations may feel the need to maintain 
complete product lines in certain therapeutic 
areas to serve their customers and sustain their 

commercial organizations. At the same time, 
innovative pipelines are often lagging behind 
from a China perspective: new products may not 
be earmarked for an early launch in China, and 
regulatory processes may also not fully tap into 
the options of accelerated approvals that exist for 
innovative products. At both ends, bold decisions 
are required to reshape portfolios for profitable 
growth in China.

Who is the optimal owner of portfolio assets?
For several decades, as MNCs shaped China’s 
medtech sector, leaders believed it necessary 
to maintain full ownership of portfolio assets. 
Today, upon closer analysis, many companies 
might find that for some parts of their business—a 
certain product category, geography, or customer 
segment—different ownership may make the 
most sense and create more value. For example, 
commoditized products may be margin dilutive 
from an MNC’s point of view; however, a local 
distributor with a different commercial model 
and different cost and overhead structure might 
well generate economic value from them. A 
medtech company could, therefore, license parts 
of its portfolio to create incremental value for 
itself and keep products available for patients 
and healthcare professionals. To be sure, this 
discussion gets more fraught when considering 
larger parts of portfolios or entire business units. 
In some other industries, entire China businesses 
have been carved out, enabling them to operate 
under different ownership and in line with local 
market requirements. Although such moves have 
yet to take place in medtech, an open discussion 
on ownership and entity structure in China should 
be part of any strategic discussion. 

Which partners can best help the company 
compete and succeed in China?
Many MNC medtechs have relied on their 
own resources and capabilities to build their 
businesses in China. Today, trying to do things 
alone may be unnecessarily limiting. Medtech 
companies need to serve a broader market than 
in the past, including county-level hospitals. A 
vibrant local industry has sprung up; China’s digital 
ecosystem is rapidly evolving; and local investors 
are looking for attractive business ideas to fund. In 
this environment, medtech leaders should routinely 

77

Medtech Pulse: Thriving in the next decadebe asking this question: Which local partner (or 
partners) could help us achieve our business 
objectives? Companies that apply this principle 
sometimes find attractive solutions, ranging 
from asset-level licensing and complementary 
portfolios to joint ventures that provide funding 
and market access. These partnerships also 
create a shared interest in business success with 
a local entity whose secondary effect is welcome 
and appreciated.

How can China’s innovation potential be 
harnessed?
China is still a net recipient of medtech innovation: 
MNCs often create innovative products elsewhere 
and then bring them to market in China. This 
is gradually changing, however, as China is 
increasingly becoming a center of medtech 
innovation. Medtech MNCs can tap into this 
innovation in many ways. For instance, products 
invented in China might be licensed to complement 
product portfolios. Chinese medtech companies 
are also potential M&A candidates. For instance, 
Boston Scientific acquired a majority stake in 
Acotec in 2022, incorporating a locally made 
portfolio of cardiovascular intervention devices.18 
Additionally, China’s digital ecosystem abounds 
with innovation. Consider the large consumer 
health platforms operated by China digital giants 
and the advances China is making in the field of 
remote healthcare. These are but a few examples 
of product and business model innovation playing 
out in China’s medtech and healthcare industries 
that can be harnessed by MNCs to set themselves 
up for success in China and beyond.

Mind the basics: Elevating commercial 
and operational efficiencies and 
compliance
Beyond these strategic considerations, best practices 
in commercial and operations will remain a source of 
competitive advantage for leading companies. 

The market context in China requires many 
medtech MNCs to operate with lower prices, higher 
volumes, and broader footprints. Companies that 
respond well to these conditions are those that 
quickly transform the traditional high-touch model 
into one that emphasizes efficiency and agility and 
leverages omnichannel engagement.

Last, it is important for companies to stay up to 
date on evolving policy frameworks. For instance, 
China’s evolving data privacy and data security 
laws mean many MNCs need to adjust the ways 
they collect, store, and process data originating in 
China to ensure regulatory compliance. Likewise, 
the regulatory framework for local manufacturing, 
local procurement guidelines, and pricing and 
reimbursement policies continues to evolve, calling for 
MNCs to strategize and operate in China with agility.

Despite structural uncertainty, China will continue 
to be the second-largest medtech market in the 
world. Serving this market and tapping its vast 
potential will remain squarely at the top of many 
medtech senior leaders’ global agendas. Although 
there are many ways to succeed, success is more 
likely to come to those that act quickly.
