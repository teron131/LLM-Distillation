The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base to 
aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s companies 
and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, and functional 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely the responsibility 
of MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively

 — Resources of the world: Building, powering, and feeding the world sustainably

 — Human potential: Maximizing and achieving the potential of human talent

 — Global connections: Exploring how flows of goods, services, people, capital, and ideas  

shape economies

 — Technologies and markets of the future: Discussing the next big arenas of value  

and competition

We aim for independent and fact-based research. None of our work is commissioned or funded 
by any business, government, or other institution; we share our results publicly free of charge; 
and we are entirely funded by the partners of McKinsey. While we engage multiple distinguished 
external advisers to contribute to our work, the analyses presented in our publications are MGI’s 
alone, and any errors are our own.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growth© aldomurillo/Getty Images

Key findings

 — This research considers growth, inclusion, and sustainability as parts of a connected 
system. It assesses the extent to which accelerated growth can further the two defining 
societal aspirations of our time: raising minimum living standards and limiting global warming. 
It also frames the choices countries face in a decisive decade that will determine the state of 
the world in 2050.

 — Beyond ending poverty, the next challenge is progressing toward economic 

empowerment, which enables people to realize more of their potential. Economic growth 
has fueled tremendous poverty reduction in the past half century. Many have argued that the 
$2.15 per day extreme poverty line needs a complementary benchmark to gauge progress 
beyond that point. We frame this higher bar as the empowerment line, the level at which people 
can afford to meet essential needs such as nutrition, housing, healthcare, and education; 
they also gain a modest sense of security and have reduced risk of slipping back into poverty. 
Empowerment starts at $12 per day in purchasing power parity terms globally, with regional 
variations to account for different norms and costs. As of 2020, some 730 million people lived 
in extreme poverty, while 4.7 billion were below the empowerment line. 

 — The pursuit of economic empowerment must be viewed in conjunction with global 

net-zero commitments. Addressing the causes of climate change is a pressing economic 
and social challenge—and at today’s emissions levels, the carbon budget to limit warming 
to 1.5°C is trending toward being exhausted by 2030. Achieving net-zero emissions, as 
many countries have pledged to do, would require a major increase in investment and in the 
capacity of energy and resource systems. 

 — The dual goals pose tensions that need to be managed. Rapid improvement in living 

standards could raise demand for energy- and emissions-intensive products and services 
(although historical patterns could change if new consumers shift behaviors). A disorderly 
net-zero transition could increase energy and other costs for consumers and cause labor 
market frictions, creating a disproportionate burden for low-income households; if people 
feel it is crowding prospects for their lives to improve, support could waver. At the same time, 
not acting to curb temperature rise could harm economies, and the poorest populations are 
most heavily exposed to physical risks. 

 — The combined empowerment and net-zero investment gaps amount to an enormous 
8 percent of global GDP annually over the decade. We quantify the cumulative spending 
boost that would close both gaps by 2030. Lifting everyone above the empowerment 
threshold implies that the people currently below it would need 40 percent more spending 
power on average by 2030 (even more in sub-Saharan Africa and India). To get on a net-
zero trajectory, the world would need to muster an additional $41 trillion in low-emissions 
investment (above continued 2020 spending levels, cumulatively through 2030). These are 
shifts in income, consumption, and investment of an unprecedented magnitude.

 — Businesses and the market economy can generate half the combined resources through 
growth and innovation. This involves not only maintaining baseline growth but also boosting 
productivity even further through investment in technology, new businesses, and human 
capital. Accelerated growth and better-paying jobs could close almost two-thirds of the 
global empowerment gap. On the climate transition, even with current policies, we see 
potential for almost $10 trillion of low-emissions alternatives to become viable for private

changes, could unlock just over a third of the step-up needed in net-zero spending. 

 — Beyond what market forces can address under current policies, substantial gaps 
remain—and so do hard choices about whether and how to fill them. Growth and 
innovation alone could generate progress that would be historic in and of itself. Yet closing 
both gaps in full would take even more than what they can deliver without new policies and 
incentives. We estimate the unfilled economic gap at 4 percent of GDP per year globally, or 
$40 trillion, cumulatively through the decade. Developing countries account for nearly two-
thirds of this. 

 — Additional societal commitments could accelerate progress but come with their own 

risks. Combined public and private action could deliver housing, healthcare, education, and 
food that is more affordable and leads to better outcomes, potentially unlocking $3 trillion of 
benefits to those below the empowerment line. Public finance support could change the risk 
and cost profiles of net-zero investments, unlocking a further $17 trillion from private actors 
over the decade. However, such extensive commitments could distort the baseline economy. 
In a scenario where high-income economies choose to shoulder both gaps for the world, it 
would amount to 3.5 percent of their own GDP annually; the global financial system would 
need to accommodate higher cross-border flows.

 — Empowering large populations while getting on a net-zero trajectory would take 
a global push for growth, innovation, and collaboration. Growth boosts economic 
empowerment and creates the financing capacity for net zero. The upside is compelling: 
some 2.1 billion people could move above the empowerment line and 600 million people out 
of poverty, taking significant steps on their journey toward full economic empowerment. 
Yet addressing residual gaps would take bolder innovation in finance, technology, industry, 
and policy. The possibilities include creating new multilateral financing vehicles; integrating 
low-income countries into global trade in a way that lifts local communities and small 
businesses; developing sustainable cities with affordable housing; and designing effective 
carbon markets. Private actors, governments, and nonprofits would need to combine their 
capabilities and expertise—and think without limits about how they can contribute to  
meeting this moment.

Executive summary

Growth, inclusion, and sustainability are connected, often complementing one another but 
sometimes pulling in different directions.1 This research explores how growth can contribute to 
higher living standards and a greener world, building on the tremendous progress of the past half 
century. Specifically, it looks at the economics of addressing both poverty and climate change in 
a decisive way—as well as the trade-offs involved.

We focus on established global aspirations without imposing constraints on the ambitions. On 
the sustainability side, the Paris Agreement laid out a framework to limit temperature rise to well 
below 2.0°C (and preferably to 1.5°C) relative to preindustrial levels. In response, many countries 
have committed to reaching net-zero emissions. On inclusion, while the world has made historic 
strides against extreme poverty, development experts and economists have discussed setting 
a higher bar for living standards. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) propose 
achieving adequate nutrition, health, education, clean water, energy, and living conditions for 
all. The concept of economic empowerment used in this research captures these aspirations. 
For each country, we estimate the point at which individuals can meet their essential needs and 
begin to have some security. This does not undermine the goal of eliminating extreme poverty; it 
explores how to move further toward a world in which people realize more of their own potential.  

The actions taken (or not) in this decade will determine what kind of world the next generation will 
inherit. This research therefore considers how much progress could be feasible by 2030.2 The 
time frame is intentional. At today’s level of emissions, the world’s carbon budget for holding to a 
1.5°C path is expected to run out around the end of the decade. In addition, 2030 is the target for 
the SDGs. Without faster progress on empowerment, the next generation could enter adulthood 
ill-equipped for the jobs of the future, putting many at risk of falling further behind. 

Since these are urgent, simultaneous challenges, we bring them together to offer a more holistic 
view, considering the interactions between growth, economic inclusion, and the net-zero transition 
(Exhibit E1). Productivity-driven growth lifts incomes and raises living standards while unlocking the 
financing capacity needed for a low-emissions future. Meanwhile, innovation that goes hand in hand 
with growth can bring down the costs of low-emissions technologies. This could lower the spending 
needed for the transition and reduce the risk of households facing higher costs as a result. 

Yet tensions exist in the system. Global economic empowerment implies billions of people  
with growing demand for energy, while a disorderly net-zero transition could create challenges of 
affordability. Some may view investment in the transition as a project that crowds out prospects 
for their lives to improve—but since the poorest populations are most exposed to the physical 
risks of climate change, reducing those risks is part of ensuring general well-being. 

This research sizes the empowerment and net-zero gaps and explores scenarios of how they 
could theoretically be closed. The empowerment gap is the cumulative boost in consumption 
needed to meet everyone’s essential needs by 2030, while the net-zero investment gap is the 
cumulative spending on low-emissions technologies needed over the decade, above what is 

1  While inclusion intersects with issues of race and gender, this report focuses on economic inclusion for the population as a 
whole. MGI and McKinsey have a large body of research examining inclusion from racial and gender perspectives. Similarly, 
while sustainability encompasses many priorities, this research focuses specifically on the net-zero transition.

2  We use a 2020 starting point to give a clear decade-long view of potential progress. Scenarios from the Network for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS), the basis for our sustainability analysis, use 2020 as their starting point. Based on investment 
in low-emissions assets and increases in empowerment in 2021 and 2022, the scale of spending needed this decade has not 
dramatically shifted.

happening at present. Since neither could be addressed instantaneously, we assume steadily 
upward progress over the decade. This hypothetical would require the equivalent of 8 percent of 
global GDP annually, with significant variations by region. 

This is obviously a massive sum, and its scale leads us to explore how much market forces 
could deliver. We find that accelerated growth and business innovation could take the world 
halfway to closing the combined gaps. Companies can make major contributions and benefit 
from new opportunities, even under current policy frameworks.

Beyond this point, the remaining economic gaps leave societies with choices about whether 
to address both challenges in full, in part, or not at all. Countries might prioritize one of these 
transformations over the other, or leave both unaddressed beyond what market forces can do. They 
might also attempt to make partial progress on both fronts. Closing the gaps would require protecting

potentially making societal commitments equivalent to 2 percent of global GDP, as an annual average, 
over the decade ($20 trillion cumulatively). Importantly, societal commitments would activate more 
innovation and investment by private actors. But actions on this scale would also take economies into 
uncharted territory, demanding more attention to maintaining economic growth and stability. 

Societies are already spending on the twin priorities. In 2020, some 90 percent of the $1.4 trillion 
of global net-zero spending was either made by the public sector or subsidized in some way. 
About 20 percent of the consumption of people below the empowerment line was supported by 
public and social spending on in-kind transfers in 2020, by our estimates. 

Are there further opportunities to close gaps without risking growth? All economies have 
constraints on fiscal resources. They would need to weigh those constraints against the 
implications of leaving urgent needs unaddressed—and against the potential longer-term payoff 
of an economically empowered population and a stable climate. Our research aims to provide 
ambition, provocation, and a fact base to inform these debates. 

Economic empowerment raises living standards 
More than a billion people have exited extreme poverty in recent decades. Yet large populations 
above this line lack adequate healthcare, quality education for their children, or decent housing. 
The SDGs incorporate higher aspirations, while the UN Development Programme calls to 
“expand the sense of possibility in people’s lives.”3 When people have health, education, and 
stability, they are equipped to improve their own circumstances. 

Continuing to raise the bar everywhere in the world
The World Bank’s extreme poverty line was recently updated from $1.90 to $2.15 per person per 
day (in purchasing power parity, or PPP, terms).4 But as more people exceed it, the world needs a 
complementary benchmark to track progress toward a higher living standard. 

The concept of economic empowerment described in this research ensures that everyone has 
the means to access the full range of basics (Exhibit E2). Empowerment still implies living in 
frugal circumstances. But people can begin to build a modest buffer for weathering emergencies 
and can invest in themselves to become more productive.5 

When people rise meaningfully above poverty, many outcomes improve, including childhood 
mortality, life expectancy, years of schooling, and digital and financial inclusion. Life satisfaction 
increases when people shed the stress of not being able to make ends meet and can fulfill more 
of their material desires.6  

How we quantify the higher bar
We start with consumption of $12 per person per day in PPP terms as a global floor, in line with 
other research (see Box E1, “Measuring economic inclusion”). For countries at higher income levels,

4  This 2022 update in the global poverty line also involved changing from 2011 PPP terms to 2017 PPP terms.

households in India. See From poverty to empowerment: India’s imperative for jobs, growth, and effective basic services,

and turning points around the world,” Nature Human Behaviour, volume 2, 2018, found a similar relationship between life 
satisfaction and prosperity globally.

we raise the line to account for local norms and the costs of food, housing and energy, safe water 
access, transportation, healthcare, education, clothing, and communication, using WageIndicator 
data as of 2022 and 2023. Purchasing power is consistently set to obtain that basket of goods 
plus a small margin for social activities and savings.7 The housing may be a modest apartment; the 
transportation could be a transit pass, a used car, or perhaps a motorbike in some contexts. 

We then convert from PPP terms to 2020 US dollars. Expressed that way, the empowerment 
threshold ranges between $3 and $50 per capita per day across the countries in our data 
set.8 To give some examples, the line is about $3 per capita in Afghanistan and Sudan; $4 to 
$5 in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria; $8 to $11 in China, Mexico, South Africa, and Thailand; 
$15 to $45 in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and Poland; and $50 in the United States. 
Establishing each country’s threshold makes it possible to size its empowerment gap—the 
share of the population that falls short of sufficiency as well as the dollar amount that would 
bridge this gap. 

7  We note that having one empowerment threshold for a given country does not reflect how housing and other costs vary from 

region to region within the country; it costs more to live an empowered life in an expensive major city than in a poorer rural area.

8  Iceland and Switzerland are outliers on the upper end of the empowerment line range and above $50.

Measuring economic inclusion

It’s been said that you can’t improve what 
you can’t measure. In the case of poverty, 
the challenge is not a lack of metrics but 
rather a proliferation of them.1 Starting with 
the holistic SDGs, economic inclusion can 
be framed as moving everyone toward 
health and well-being, education, affordable 
essentials, and sustainable communities. 

Poverty can be more specifically expressed 
in monetary or nonmonetary terms.2 It is 
often calculated monetarily by looking 
at income or consumption, using both 
absolute and relative terms or a hybrid of the 
two (exhibit). The World Bank, for example, 
sets its global extreme poverty line at 
$2.15 per person per day in 2017 purchasing 
power parity terms. This is the median of 
national poverty lines in more than two 
dozen of the world’s poorest countries.3 
To account for higher living standards 
as countries move up the development 
curve, the World Bank introduced poverty 
lines specific to lower-middle- and upper-
middle-income economies.4  

Another approach uses the extreme poverty 
threshold as a floor, combined with lines that 
rise with countries’ income levels.5 Others 
have proposed an entirely relative line based 
on median income or consumption.6  

Another set of literature uses the aspiration 
for everyone globally to reach a higher living 
standard. Development economist Lant 
Pritchett, for example, proposes using the 
high-income poverty threshold universally, 
arguing that there is basic unfairness in 
setting a line with lower living standards in 
developing countries.7  The lower bound of a 
high-income poverty threshold has inspired 
definitions of a global middle class, a topic 
of debate. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo 
have explored the consumption patterns 
that point to someone exiting poverty and 
entering the global middle class.8  

The concept of economic empowerment 
in this research defines a minimum 
acceptable standard of living as having 
the means to afford nutrition, education, 
healthcare, housing, water and sanitation, 
and energy. Many of these aspirations are 
embodied in the SDGs; they are essential 
to enabling people to realize more of 
their potential. Empowerment starts with 
an absolute floor that lifts people past 
the point at which they are no longer at 
extreme risk of falling back into poverty.9  
Research from Brookings economist Homi 
Kharas (cofounder of World Data Lab, 
one of the main sources of data for this 

analysis) suggests that this level is $12 per 
person per day in PPP terms.10  

Since we aim to use a common definition 
of basic needs and security worldwide, 
why not an absolute PPP threshold? 
First, the data set from the WageIndicator 
Foundation that we use for setting 
thresholds above the global floor prices a 
consistent basket of essential goods and 
services, not the economy-wide basket 
used in PPP measures.11 Second, some 
costs vary due to differing norms for 
the type or amount of a good or service 
related to empowerment (for example, 
the type of transportation required to 
secure a job or the minimum quantity of 
healthcare available to consumers). Our 
approach therefore gradually scales up 
empowerment lines for countries with 
progressively higher levels of income.12 

Our approach is consistent with economist 
Martin Ravallion’s view: “Any absolute 
line you choose will not adjust over time 
or across countries for differences in the 
costs of avoiding social exclusion and 
relative deprivation. . . . Where and when 
you live matters as to whether you should 
be considered poor at any given level of real 
consumption.”13 Nobel laureate Amartya

Sen also notes that what is needed for daily 
life may differ across societies.14   

Empowerment is related to the “living 
wage” concept that has gained traction 
for employers and workers to evaluate 
wages against living costs. It has been 
broadly defined as the amount individuals 
need to earn to cover their basic household 
expenses plus taxes.15 The empowerment 
line is a consumption-based counterpart that 
complements this income-based metric.

In both high- and low-income countries, we 
view empowerment as the point at which 
people can begin to invest in themselves and 
have a fuller range of choices about shaping 
their lives. This echoes Sen’s assertions that 
income alone does not reflect well-being. 
Economic empowerment conveys the ability 
to participate in society, the freedom to enjoy 
life, and individual agency. 

In this research, we determine what it 
would take to lift the poorest population 
segments, a goal that has widespread 
support. We explicitly do not model 
redistribution from the wealthiest 
segments as the means to achieve this. We 
also recognize that poverty intersects with 
issues of race and gender, but this analysis 
does not incorporate demographics. 

Finally, economic inclusion raises the larger 
topics of inequality and redistribution.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthBecause we use a consumption-based metric, taxes and direct transfers are already 
taken into account. Cost-of-living thresholds are then adjusted for the estimated in-kind 
transfers provided in each country. Universal healthcare, for example, lowers out-of-pocket 
healthcare costs for individuals. We note, however, the challenges of accurately tracking 
how public services reach the targeted recipients. Indeed, one way for countries to advance 
empowerment is through logistical and operational improvements to ensure that social benefit 
programs can be accessed by their intended beneficiaries. 

Finally, we note that empowerment is a per-person metric. Families that combine their resources 
would have better prospects for meeting their basic needs than individuals below this line living alone. 

Who is not fully economically empowered?
About 4.7 billion people worldwide (approximately 60 percent of the global population) are not 
yet fully economically empowered by this benchmark (Exhibit E3).9 Some 4.4 billion of them live in

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthFor many people below the 
empowerment line, especially in the 
world’s major cities, the high cost of 
housing eats into other priorities. 

low- and middle-income countries; nearly half are in sub-Saharan Africa and India. Some may live 
in rural villages far from the nearest medical clinic; others are in crowded urban tenements.

Yet more than 300 million people in high-income countries also fall into this category, including 
just over a quarter of the population in the United States and in the European Union and 
United Kingdom. While even high-income countries have some degree of homelessness and 
deprivation, most of the population below the empowerment line in these regions does not 
experience such severe poverty. Yet some of their essential needs are not sufficiently met. 
In many cases, the high cost of housing eats into other priorities. People may not be able to 
invest in better education or training for themselves or their children. Closer to the threshold, 
a person may rent a basic apartment with a decently equipped kitchen; he may even own 
a TV, a mobile phone, or a used car. But living paycheck to paycheck means there is little 
savings to handle emergencies, move, or retire comfortably. Someone whose family members 
have disabilities may have limited prospects for employment without caregiving support, 
for example.

The family of four squeezed into a small studio apartment in Los Angeles is not fully empowered. 
Neither is the street vendor in Lima nor the subsistence farmer in Laos. 

The magnitude of lifting everyone to empowerment 
Our analysis assumes that people below the line gain a bit more spending power each year through 
2030. Because we adopt a common time frame for the world, this ramp-up to full empowerment 
would be steeper for the poorest deciles and more gradual for deciles closer to the line. 

Using these parameters, achieving universal empowerment by 2030 would involve boosting the 
cumulative consumption of 4.7 billion people worldwide over the decade by just over $37 trillion 
(the empowerment gap). This boost is equivalent to 40 percent of this cohort’s continued 
spending at 2020 levels.10 We note that the gap is the product of how the threshold and the 
timeline are set. Lowering the threshold or allowing this trajectory to play out over a longer time 
frame would produce different results.

Making progress toward closing the empowerment gap matters. For billions of people, achieving 
minimum living standards is the foremost existential issue. Their hopes involve getting out of 
unsustainably high debt, securing healthcare for their children, or moving in search of a better 
job. Leaving so many people in vulnerable circumstances imposes limits on growth and risks 
destabilizing societies. 

10 The empowerment gap refers exclusively to the boost in spending power over 2020 levels. The current consumption of people 

below empowerment thresholds would amount to some $94 trillion over ten years, if extended at current levels.

16

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthEmpowerment could yield long-term benefits—and not only for the individuals whose lives 
improve. It would eventually create a virtuous cycle. Many more people would have the skills and 
agency to participate in a knowledge-intensive and digital economy. They would also become 
consumers, fueling future growth. 

The net-zero investment gap is the incremental low-emissions 
spending needed by 2030 to change the climate trajectory 
Alongside the aspiration to raise living standards, countries and companies worldwide have 
committed to reducing emissions to net zero, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C relative to 
preindustrial levels in the current century. This research builds on scenarios from the Network 
for Greening the Financial System to quantify the low-emissions spending needed to get on 
this pathway by 2030 (see Box E2, “Measuring the net-zero investment need”). Across seven 
sectors globally, our analysis finds the biggest needs in power and mobility (Exhibit E4).  

This research looks at scenarios of baseline economic growth (2.7 percent globally) and 
accelerated growth (3.4 percent globally).11 Given the critical importance of growth to economic 

11  Baseline growth relies on projections from Oxford Economics (aggregating different growth rates across countries). 

Accelerated growth is an adjusted scenario in which productivity gains add another 0.7 percentage point.

Box E2

Measuring the net-zero investment need

We build on scenarios from the Network 
for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), 
adjusting for baseline and accelerated 
growth. NGFS scenarios are frequently 
used in risk analysis, provide regional 
granularity, and include a holistic view 
of emissions. This analysis is performed 
for approximately 50 key low-emissions 
technologies and 12 regions, addressing 
85 percent of global greenhouse gas 
emissions. In some cases, NGFS variables 
were downscaled for more granular 
quantification. Our “investment” need 
includes both capital investment and 
consumer spending on items such as 
electric vehicles. We include only low-
emissions investments such as solar 
and wind power, while excluding high-
emissions investments in areas such as 
fossil fuels. 

We build on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 
scenario (with warming of 1.5°C by 2100) 
to estimate the incremental low-emissions 
investment that would be needed (the net-
zero investment gap). The NGFS Current 
Policies scenario enables us to estimate 
how much spending is likely under current 
policy frameworks (with warming of about 
3.0°C by 2100). Other “current policy” 
scenarios may produce slightly different 
warming outcomes, though all would find a 
gap with a net-zero trajectory. 

We also employ the McKinsey Transition 
Finance Model to answer the question of 
who pays. First we determine, for each 
lever and region combination, the share of 
grant and concessional spending required 
to make low-emissions technologies 
cost competitive with high-emissions

alternatives based on their total cost of 
ownership, and to compensate consumers 
and companies for the technological and 
market risks associated with them. We 
rely on this modeling even for 2020, due 
to limited data on present-day subsidies; 
however, where available, we have 
triangulated our results with actual data. 
The rest of the spending need is then split 
between private actors (corporations 
and consumers) and public actors 
(governments, state-owned enterprises, 
multilaterals, and philanthropies) based 
on historical patterns and expert input. 
We acknowledge the many uncertainties 
in both this allocation and the size of the 
investment gap.1

inclusion, we use the higher assumption for net zero, a scenario that could add an estimated 
3 gigatons (Gt) of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2030 if historical relations of growth and 
emissions hold. This means that low-emissions spending would correspondingly need to scale 
up almost $5 trillion globally beyond what would be needed in a baseline scenario. In this high-
growth world, getting on track for net zero would take cumulative investment and spending of 
$55 trillion on low-emissions assets over the decade—a step-up of $41 trillion as compared with 

18

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthsimply extending 2020 levels. We refer to this step-up as the net-zero investment gap.12 At the 
same time, higher growth would expand the world’s financing capacity.

It is important to note that this $41 trillion figure does not reflect the world’s full energy and land-
use investment; it excludes spending on high-emissions assets. Some high-emissions spending 
would continue, particularly in developing economies that are still expanding energy access, 
but overall global levels would fall. Some of the step-up in low-emissions spending could be 
captured as capital is reallocated away from high-emissions assets, provided that low-emissions 
alternatives become viable and cost competitive. 

Our analysis assumes that providing incentives for low-emissions spending through subsidies 
would produce the same outcome as discouraging high-emissions spending through taxes. 
In practice, however, more policy mechanisms are needed to limit high-emissions spending. 
Some scholars have pointed to carbon taxes and subsidies as complements rather than a binary 
choice, especially at early stages of the net-zero transition.13  

Empowerment and the net-zero transition affect each other—and some  
tensions would need to be managed
As people move toward empowerment, their consumption rises. As mentioned earlier, our analysis 
builds in the assumption that higher economic growth increases the net-zero financing need, 
relying on the historical relationship of growth to the production and consumption of energy- and 
emissions-intensive products. Going further to achieve full empowerment by 2030 could push 
these needs—and therefore emissions—even higher than what is accounted for in this adjustment. 

Using data from India, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we estimate that 
moving everyone to the empowerment line could raise demand for energy-intensive products 
and services, and in turn emissions, by as much as an additional 15 percent above the effects of 
accelerated growth alone.14 However, significant uncertainties surround the effects of growth 
and empowerment on emissions. Historical patterns could change, for example, if consumers 
shift behaviors. 

Just as empowerment affects the net-zero transition, the reverse is also true. If interventions 
such as carbon taxes increase the costs of energy and other goods for consumers, they could 
create a disproportionate burden for people below the empowerment line.15 Actions such as 
recycling carbon tax revenue into transfers or subsidies could protect low-income households 
and provide economic development for distressed communities.16 

12 These figures differ from those in our 2022 report The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring. Here we focus 
only on low-emissions spending rather than total high- and low-emissions spending, and we use a 2030 rather than a 2050 
time frame. This research also includes updated data and refined assumptions.

13 For example, see Daron Acemoglu et al., “The environmental and directed technical change,” American Economic Review, 

volume 102, number 1, February 2012.

14 Data on household energy expenditures from the UK Office for National Statistics, US Consumer Expenditure Survey, Statistics 

South Africa, and India 68th Round of National Sample Survey. Energy expenditures are uplifted for each decile under the 
empowerment line, then used to estimate the relative increase in emissions per capita for each country (based on World Bank 
CO2 energy-related emissions data for each country’s direct emissions). Does not include non-energy and non-CO2 emissions, 
which could change the estimate.

15 Energy prices could rise in the near term, for example, if carbon prices are imposed before low-emissions energy sources are 

widely available and cost competitive. But they could also decline over the longer term (for example, due to the lower operating 
costs of renewable energy sources and through energy efficiency).

16 See, for example, Jonathan L. Ramseur and Jane A. Leggett, Attaching a price to greenhouse gas emissions with a carbon tax 
or emissions fee: Considerations and potential impacts, US Congressional Research Service, 2019; Frederick van der Ploeg 
and Maria Chiara Paoli, “Recycling revenue to improve political feasibility of carbon pricing in the UK,” VoxEU, October 2021; 
and Baoping Shang, The poverty and distributional impacts of carbon pricing: Channels and policy implications, IMF working 
paper, 2021.

19

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthThe net-zero transition could produce a surge of jobs in construction, certain types of 
manufacturing, and operations. Previous MGI research found that job gains could slightly 
outweigh job losses globally.17 However, the small net impact disguises the possibility of 
substantial churn as jobs are redistributed across industries and regions. In addition, the jobs 
being added may require different skills.

These potential impacts on households and labor markets make it crucial to manage the transition 
effectively and support consumers and workers in the most affected regions and sectors. 

The two aspirations also have complementary aspects. Not acting to curb temperature rise could 
harm growth—and empowerment—substantially through effects such as impairing the ability to 
work outdoors, agricultural losses, and damage to capital stock. Lower-income people would 
become even more exposed to hazards if climate change is not convincingly addressed. And 
research has shown that as households become more empowered, they are more likely to be 
aware of the risks of climate change and, in turn, lend support to net-zero policies.18 

The gaps vary widely across regions 
The empowerment and net-zero investment gaps vary in magnitude across different parts of the 
world, not only in absolute dollar terms but also relative to GDP. 

In the timeline we have set to 2030, the global empowerment gap would be equivalent to about 
4 percent of world GDP on average annually. However, it is only 1 percent of annual GDP in high-
income regions, including Australia, Canada, the European Union and the United Kingdom, 
Japan, New Zealand, and the United States (Exhibit E5). 

In developing regions, the starting point is harder. The total empowerment gap is the equivalent 
of 4 percent of GDP on average annually in the Middle East, 6 percent in Asia (not including 
China, India, or Japan), 7 percent in Latin America, 13 percent in India, and a daunting 45 percent 
in sub-Saharan Africa. 

The net-zero investment gap is also equivalent to about 4 percent of global GDP each year. It 
ranges from about 2 percent of GDP in Japan to 14 percent on average annually in India (Exhibit E6). 

High-income regions have an annual net-zero investment gap on the order of about 3 percent 
of annual GDP on average, about four to five times higher than their 2020 levels of investment. 
Most developing regions have a larger net-zero investment gap relative to GDP. They face the twin 
challenges of replacing fossil fuel generation while substantially broadening energy access and 
meeting the energy needs of growing economies—and doing so in a low-emissions way.19

Employment and Social Outlook 2018: Greening with jobs, International Labour Organization, 2018.

18 Higher-income households are more likely to buy products with sustainability-related claims; see “Consumers care about 

sustainability—and back it up with their wallets,” McKinsey & Company, February 2023.

19 NGFS scenarios account for differences in likely emissions reduction trajectories across developed and developing economies. 

Developed countries typically reach net zero earlier than developing countries.

Growth and business-led innovation could be the biggest drivers of  
economic empowerment 
How could populations below the empowerment line gain more spending power? Our scenario 
starts with growth. By our estimates, aggregate baseline growth of 2.7 percent per year globally 
could generate enough income to give our target population the ability to meet some $14 trillion 

22

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthmore of their needs over ten years.20 This could help lift 830 million people into empowerment 
by 2030 and bring some 160 million people out of poverty, reducing the share of the global 
population in poverty from 11 to 8 percent.21  

On top of this, businesses can improve productivity to accelerate global growth. Farm and non-farm 
sectors have the potential to raise productivity, in aggregate, by at least 0.5 to 1.0 percent each year 
across regions, as outlined in many prior MGI research efforts.22 This is not only about cost-saving 
efficiencies; it is also about innovation and new business creation, new types of work, and products and 
services that address new markets. If global growth could reach 3.4 percent annually by harnessing 
such opportunities, more resources would also become available for public goods and social spending.

Increasing investment and technology adoption will be key to these efforts. This creates the 
challenge—and the opportunity—to upskill workers to use those technologies and make 
successful job transitions into more productive sectors and better-paying occupations. Previous 
MGI research has explored the scale of the skill shifts and occupational transitions that will likely 
be needed in the years ahead.23 Our analysis here suggests that roughly 10 percent of lower- and 
mid-skill workers could see their wages rise if they are equipped to take on higher-skill jobs by 
2030 in response to technology, sector-specific growth opportunities, and other trends. 

Businesses have a critical role here. About half of workers’ lifetime earnings is due to skill 
building through work experience and learning on the job; this dynamic is especially important for 
those without educational credentials who start out in low-wage work.24 Businesses can become 
more productive by accelerating this process: during the pandemic, for example, US workers 
moved into different occupations, including better-paying ones, at a rate 50 percent higher than 
in the past.25 But upskilling does not happen without intentional effort. It will be a heavy lift for 
businesses to improve this dynamic, especially where the process involves bringing people from 
subsistence farming into more productive work.

All told, higher growth combined with creating and filling more productive jobs could close an 
additional $10 trillion of the global empowerment gap beyond what baseline growth can deliver, 
by our estimates. This includes the impact of social and public transfers rising in line with higher 
growth. This could raise living standards and transform lives on a massive scale, lifting 2.1 billion 
people into empowerment and 600 million more out of poverty. In this scenario, the share of the 
global population below the empowerment line drops from 60 percent to 30 percent and the 
share in poverty shrinks to 3 percent over the decade. 

Lower-income countries would take longer to achieve full empowerment. But accelerated 
economic growth could eliminate the most severe forms of poverty in much of the world by 2030 
(although we note the unique difficulties in places where conflicts are ongoing, among other 
deep-rooted structural issues). 

20 The lift required for global empowerment is based on 2020 empowerment thresholds. We do not adjust annually, although the 
line may in fact rise due to increasing per capita income, changes in input costs, and other factors. Conversely, we also do not 
model the potential positive GDP implications of having many more empowered and productive workers.

21  We use 20 percent of the empowerment line as a proxy for poverty. For countries at the floor of $12 PPP per day, this is slightly 

higher than the World Bank’s $2.15 line.

a new era (February 2023).

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthThe toughest challenge is in sub-Saharan Africa. If economic growth remains at the baseline, 
the absolute numbers of those experiencing the most extreme deprivation might actually tick 
up as the population rises. But accelerated productivity-driven growth could cut that population 
in half, which translates to 250 million people exiting poverty. The gap remaining to fully erase 
poverty in this scenario amounts to $120 billion over a decade, equivalent to about 5 percent of 
total public spending in these countries, projected at historical rates. At the same time, living 
standards would continue to improve for the rest of the population. In a high-growth scenario, the 
population above 50 percent of the empowerment standard would rise from 260 million in 2020 
to 550 million in 2030. Transforming so many lives would expand the continent’s possibilities 
(see Box E3, “The empowerment opportunity for Africa”). 

Some $15 trillion of new low-emissions spending could be 
unlocked this decade through growth and innovation
How much low-emissions spending can be spurred by growth and innovation? And what role will 
private actors play? This depends on whether each low-emissions investment opportunity is “in 
the money”—that is, competitive in total cost of ownership relative to traditional alternatives. We 
have analyzed these by technology, sector, and region.

Only about 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion low-emissions investment in 2020 was fully private. Our 
model starts by assuming these levels continue over the decade. This would mean an additional 
$14 trillion coming on stream by 2030.26  

On top of that, an additional $15 trillion in investment could occur, even without changes to the policy 
frameworks that existed in 2020.27 Of this, $3 trillion could come from current investment simply 
rising in line with baseline growth (assuming that spending levels stay consistent as a share of GDP). 
The remaining $12 trillion could occur with accelerated economic growth and, more importantly, with 
technological advances on the horizon making low-emissions alternatives more cost competitive. 

While some of this $15 trillion step-up would continue to be financed or subsidized by public 
budgets, the majority could consist of “in the money” spending by the private sector. Combined 
with continued spending at 2020 levels, some $10 trillion in low-emissions spending could 
become viable for private actors by 2030. 

Where exactly are these “in the money” opportunities? The power and mobility sectors in China, 
Europe, India, and the United States collectively make up about 70 percent of this category—and 
these are precisely the areas with the biggest needs for investment. Action is already building 
in these areas. With new supply chains turning out batteries and a wider array of models hitting 
the market, electric vehicles are poised to become more affordable. Meanwhile, technology 
advances and continued cost reductions could create almost $700 billion of new viable 
investment opportunities across solar and wind generation in these regions. 

26 Our breakdown of spending across public and private actors is based on a granular bottom-up modeled assessment across 

technologies and regions. For the public sector, we include grants and concessional financing and direct public spending. We 
have triangulated our results from 2020 with external estimates and find them broadly in line. Any discrepancies are likely due 
to differences in how subsidies are accounted for.

27 This includes, for example, carbon taxes in place as of 2020 in the EU.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthThe extent to which growth, innovation, and continued current 
policies could close the combined gaps varies by region
Market forces—the combination of higher productivity-driven growth, business innovation, and 
technology advances—plus the continuation of current policies and public commitments could 
move the world much further on both fronts. At the global level, these forces could close roughly 
half of the combined empowerment and net-zero investment gaps (Exhibit E7). By our estimates,

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthjust under one extra percentage point of growth reduces the unfilled empowerment gap by more 
than one percentage point of GDP.28 

But growth and business-led innovation have uneven potential across countries (Exhibit E8). 

By 2030, these two forces could fill roughly 55 to 85 percent of the empowerment gap in high-
income regions. Across the rest of the world, the picture varies widely. The greatest potential lift 
could occur in India and China. Accelerated growth and business innovation could erase more 
than 90 percent of the empowerment gaps in both countries, lifting about 700 million people in 
India and over 730 million in China above the threshold by 2030. But these two forces may have 
lower impact by 2030 in many other developing countries. 

For net zero, the potential impact of growth is less, as discussed previously. Growth and 
business-led innovation plus continued current policies could together fill about 30 to 
60 percent of the gap, with economies in Asia (apart from India) at the lower end.

largely constant as a share of GDP.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthThe residual gaps raise fundamental questions 
After accounting for growth, business innovation, and continued current policies, the unfilled 
gaps amount to $40 trillion across both empowerment and net zero. This is the global total, 
cumulative through the decade, with roughly $13 trillion on the empowerment side and 
$26 trillion for net-zero investments through 2030. Each country and region has a unique share 
of this residual gap, depending on its current development challenges, its growth prospects, and 
how carbon-intensive its economy currently is (Exhibit E9). Developing countries account for 
nearly two-thirds of the residual gap globally.

public-private action 
The choices societies make about prioritizing these aspirations and putting resources into  
them can produce a broad range of outcomes. 

If economic growth stays at the baseline, but innovation does not bring down the cost of  
low-emissions technologies as much as expected and no additional commitments are  
made, some 830 million people would cross the empowerment line by 2030. But some  
3.9 billion would remain below it, and the world would be on a trajectory for over 3.0°C of 
warming in 2100.29

The empowerment opportunity for Africa 

This report builds on NGFS scenarios 
for its net-zero analyses. We therefore 
use NGFS regional groupings for our 
economic empowerment analysis to make 
the two goals more comparable. Yet the 
African continent is bigger and more 
diverse than the focus on sub-Saharan 
countries implies. 

Looking at the entirety of Africa adds  
in other major economies, including  
Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. While 
90 percent of the population in sub-
Saharan Africa alone is below the 
empowerment line, that share shrinks 
to 85 percent for the entire continent. 
Africa’s gap to reach full empowerment 
is equivalent to 33 percent of GDP, down 
from 45 percent of regional GDP for  
sub-Saharan Africa alone. 

Yet economic empowerment is not a binary 
condition, and what matters is progress 
along the continuum. Some 70 percent 

of the entire continent’s population was 
below 50 percent of full empowerment 
in 2020. Getting them above this 
intermediate benchmark would be a major 
stride in development. This would require 
a boost in spending power equivalent 
to 11 percent of GDP, roughly in line with 
India’s full empowerment gap—and 
significant progress is achievable through 
faster growth and business-led innovation. 

Just as the story changes while zooming 
out to the full continent, it also becomes 
more nuanced when zooming in to 
individual countries. Beneath the regional 
aggregates are some economies that 
have stronger recent growth momentum 
and others with large populations 
closer to full empowerment. In Algeria, 
Botswana, Egypt, and Morocco, for 
example, market-led opportunities 
could close at least 70 percent of the full 
empowerment gaps—and get the entirety 
of these countries’ populations above 

the 50 percent benchmark. Meanwhile, 
countries such as Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, 
Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, and Tanzania 
could rely on market forces to get 
more than half of their populations to 
50 percent of full empowerment. 

In our scenario of accelerated growth, 
some 770 million people across the 
continent could be above 50 percent of 
the empowerment line by 2030—almost 
doubling the number in 2020 (exhibit). 
At the same time, the number of people 
living in extreme poverty would drop by 
just under 270 million over the decade. 
As noted in recent MGI research, African 
economies can accelerate these outcomes 
through digitization, talent development, 
regional collaboration, and industry 
champions.1 These strategies could attract 
more international investment, creating 
self-sustaining momentum that transforms 
millions of lives.

Exhibit E10 shows the degrees of progress that could be achieved in line with higher growth, 
innovation, and commitments. While these are global results, the trade-offs differ across 
countries and regions.

 — Innovation-led accelerated growth. Countries could choose to rely solely on maximizing 
what market forces can do. With higher economic growth and innovation delivering the 
anticipated productivity improvements and reductions in the price of low-emissions 
technologies, 2.1 billion people could move above the empowerment threshold, but the world 
would be on a 3.0°C warming path. This would produce much more progress, especially on the 
empowerment side, than the current trajectory, although it would be far from closing the gaps. 

 — Commitment to partially address either gap. Assuming high growth and innovation, 

societies could choose to address one of the residual gaps, leaving the other to be addressed 
by market forces alone. The exhibit illustrates societies choosing to tackle net zero 
completely but not empowerment. The choice is not binary, of course. Many combinations 
could yield partial progress on both challenges in tandem. 

 — Commitment to fully close both gaps. In this scenario, the global population would be fully 
empowered with a higher standard of living, and the world would be on track to achieve net 
zero by mid-century, hopefully limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100. This would take a best-

case scenario of global growth and innovation along with commitments that wholly—and 
effectively—address the combined $40 trillion residual gap over the decade. 

The important assumption in the final two scenarios is that public commitments on such a scale 
would spur additional private activity and investment. However, it is possible that such extensive 
commitments could distort the baseline economy. 

30

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthThese scenarios lead us to three questions about how additional commitments could 
theoretically close the last-mile gaps as well as the implications for countries that lack the 
economic resources. 

Question 1: How could societies get closer to full empowerment 
beyond what current market forces can do? 
The options for closing the residual $13 trillion economic gap for universal empowerment 
involve delivering essential goods and services more affordably and effectively, improving work 
arrangements and pay, and injecting more direct support. As a thought experiment, we quantify 
some of these avenues, cautioning that the effects of intervention on this scale are not known 
(Exhibit E11).

their commitments and make essentials more affordable.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthFirst, beyond incomes, one of the biggest factors determining empowerment is the price of 
essential goods and services. Multiple efficiencies could bring down these costs. Benchmarking 
against the productivity gains and outcome improvements that some countries have achieved 
in past decades, we estimate the potential to improve capacity and productivity in housing, 
healthcare, education, and nutrition. If these are passed on to consumers, they could yield some 
$3 trillion of benefits to those below the empowerment line (cumulatively through 2030). In 
effect, this would lower the empowerment threshold. In places where the public sector provides 
essential services, looking for operational efficiencies and raising the bar for quality can ensure 
that public funds are well spent. Beyond the financial savings, these could yield immense 
benefits in terms of well-being and human potential. 

For instance, we estimate that improved construction productivity could lower housing 
expenditures by 11 percent globally if all countries emulated their best-performing peers and 
these gains reached consumers. Health outcomes (expressed in healthy life expectancies) 
could improve by 36 percent globally, even keeping current levels of healthcare spending 
constant, if each country matched its best-performing peer over the next decade. Globally, 
we find an opportunity to improve learning outcomes (expressed as both years of schooling 
and test performance) by 42 percent, with the greatest potential gains in low- and middle-
income countries.

Policies and incentives could spur more business attention and innovation in the affordable 
segments of the housing, healthcare, food, and education markets. In housing, for example, local 
governments can change regulations related to land use, density, and permitting to lower costs 
for private developers. They can also require a percentage of affordable units in larger multifamily 
projects or offer concessional finance to buyers and developers of affordable housing.

On a different front, more labor-friendly policies and business decisions to offer higher wages or 
benefits could address labor’s declining share of national incomes, particularly in high-income 
economies. This could occur alongside structural factors we have accounted for as part of 
economic growth, such as changing employment mixes. 

For the remaining unfilled $10 trillion global gap, one option could be well-administered transfers 
to households. While better-paying jobs are the biggest driver of higher living standards, 
transfers can be targeted to those who do not benefit from these opportunities, especially the 
very poorest, those living in remote communities, children, the elderly, and people unable to 
work. In many places, there is room to make subsidy programs more transparent. Digital tools can 
spot leakages while streamlining eligibility processes and delivering benefits more efficiently. In 
addition, governments, philanthropies, social investors, development finance institutions, and 
multilateral agencies could consider increased direct funding for affordable housing, health, and 
quality education. 

A $10 trillion incremental commitment to achieve full empowerment would be equivalent 
to about 3 percent of total global government budgets over the decade (assuming both 
accelerated growth and government spending held constant at its current share of GDP). 
But the regional differences are stark. The amount needed to close the gap in the United 
States, for example, equals about 1 percent of government spending, while in sub-Saharan 
Africa, it would take 1.3 times the region’s government spending. Even if the region’s gap 
could be closed through international transfers, uncertainties remain about the potential size 
and duration of such aid. Large capital flows could affect prices, labor markets, savings, and 
ultimately growth. 

32

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthQuestion 2: What would it take to get on a true net-zero trajectory  
beyond what current market forces can do? 
After accounting for market forces, technological advances, and the continuation of current 
policies, the residual unfilled net-zero investment gap is $26 trillion, cumulative through the 
decade. This is equivalent to 3 percent of global GDP annually.

Fully addressing this unfilled economic gap would require a combined public–private effort. 
Higher public commitments could activate even more private capital and create even faster 
learning effects (that is, the lowering of costs as technologies mature and are deployed widely). 
For example, the vast majority of wind and solar will come on stream only if there is sufficient 
investment in transmission and distribution, which is largely a public-sector effort today in many 
parts of the world. All of this rests on the unproven assumption that these shifts do not damage 
the base economy. 

We present a scenario illustrating how such commitments could play out if countries choose  
to make them. Beyond the levels of public funding suggested by growth and the continuation 
of current policies, we estimate that an injection of just under $10 trillion in public funding 
could potentially unlock almost $17 trillion in additional positive impact collectively to 2030. 
Public support could take the form of concessional finance (that is, lending below market 
rates), subsidies, and projects undertaken by state-owned enterprises and development 
finance institutions. 

One-quarter of the total $55 trillion needed through 2030 could be private in-the-money 
spending (plus avoided spending), up from 10 percent in 2020. All told, some $31 trillion could 
potentially come from private actors (Exhibit E12), including what is expected to become cost 
competitive as well as what could be unlocked through additional policies and public finance. 
Public support alone makes up some 36 percent of the total in this scenario, down from half  
in 2020.

About 70 percent of crowded-in private spending could occur in the building and mobility 
sectors, based on our bottom-up modeling. Public support would be critical for building 
decarbonization, since heat pumps, a key technology, are not yet cost competitive relative to gas 
boilers. Similarly, there are significant opportunities in mobility, but public-sector support may 
still be needed, especially for heavy-duty electric vehicles, which are expected to take longer 
than battery electric passenger vehicles (BEVs) to become cost competitive.30 

Such levels of public and private action could also yield up to $4 trillion in avoided investment, 
thanks to additional R&D, economies of scale, and learning by doing. 

As with the empowerment gap, the $10 trillion of public commitment to be on track for net zero 
represents about 3 percent of total global government budgets over the decade (assuming 
both accelerated growth and government spending remain constant as a share of GDP). This 
ranges from less than 1 percent of current government budgets in the European Union and 
United Kingdom to 14 percent in India. The consequences of scaling up public commitments and 
international capital flows to this extent would be uncharted territory. 

Even if the residual gap for net zero is not fully addressed, pursuing everything that market 
forces can do would already be a tremendous ramp-up in spending and progress. At this scale, 
and with this additional momentum, the environment becomes more fertile for breakthroughs

If governments choose to address some or all of the residual gaps, they could explore making 
their spending more efficient, reallocating existing spending, issuing new debt, or raising taxes. 
Capital could also come from philanthropies, multilateral agencies, or social investors. 

Carbon pricing can play a role in spurring the switch from away from high-carbon assets. We 
model how the need for public support to achieve both empowerment and net zero would change 

34

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthif carbon taxes, rather than subsidies, were the primary vehicle to shift incentives toward low-
emissions spending.31 We found that they reduce the need for additional public support to reach 
net zero by 0.4 percentage point of GDP. At the same time, the residual empowerment gap 
would rise by 0.2 percentage point of GDP (on average annually) unless this effect is mitigated by 
revenue recycling.32 

Most high-income countries theoretically have the resources to make higher commitments if 
they choose to, although how much debt countries can carry is the subject of ongoing debate.33 
Yet the choice to aim for full empowerment, net zero, or both would involve difficult trade-offs 
with other national priorities.

Achieving full empowerment and a net-zero trajectory in the current decade appears more 
challenging for lower- and middle-income countries. Allocating large amounts to the net-
zero transition could eat into existing social welfare programs, potentially worsening the 
empowerment gap. India’s need for incremental public support to get on a net-zero pathway 
is more than 50 percent higher than the share of GDP that currently goes to social protection 
spending, for example. Debt, too, is problematic for the developing world: the IMF estimates that 
60 percent of low-income countries are already in debt distress or approaching it.34  

Yet sustainability and inclusion are global projects, with ramifications that do not stop at national 
borders. For context, if high-income countries were to take on the combined residual gaps in 
the entire world, it would require an amount equivalent to about 3.5 percent of their GDP on 
an average annual basis (up from less than 1 percent of GDP to bridge only their own residual 
gaps). Even if high-income societies were willing to bear that cost, the world would need a mix 
of mechanisms for cross-border flows that could include international aid, cross-border debt, 
assistance from multilateral institutions, and debt relief (including creative debt-for-nature or 
debt-for-climate swaps). New financial vehicles might need to be designed.

We are reaching a fork in the road
We undertook this exercise to show what is theoretically possible and inform the debate. 
Regardless of whether countries decide to increase public commitments, this research leads to 
two important takeaways. 

The importance of productivity-driven growth cannot be overstated
Faster growth propels inclusion. Almost 40 percent of the empowerment gap can be closed by 
baseline growth—and, as noted earlier, just under one extra percentage point of growth reduces 
the unfilled empowerment gap by more than one percentage point of GDP.

Additionally, growth can give governments more fiscal flexibility. The incremental GDP growth 
from higher productivity would allow for more than $30 trillion in additional public debt to be 
incurred globally without raising the 2020 global public debt–to-GDP ratio. At a global level, 

31 We use carbon prices estimated by NGFS that range from about $78 per ton of emissions in emerging economies like India to 

about $300 in the United States.

32 Based on changes in private consumption seen in the National Institute of Economic and Social Research’s NiGEM model when 
shifting from a no-transition, no-physical-risk baseline to a net-zero scenario, looking forward to 2030. NiGEM incorporates 
NGFS carbon prices as taxes, as well as NGFS energy prices.

why, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring 2019; and Oliver Blanchard, “Public debt and low interest rates,” American 
Economic Review, volume 109, number 4, April 2019.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthHigher growth and innovation could 
bring 600 million more people out 
of poverty, taking steps on a longer 
journey toward empowerment.

and specifically for high-income regions, this additional debt capacity exceeds the incremental 
public support needed to fill the empowerment and net-zero investment gaps. It is a question of 
whether or not those countries choose to assume that kind of debt, and where to allocate it. 

Visionary agendas are more likely to be pursued when the pie is growing and put aside when it 
is shrinking.35 While growth can’t overcome every structural challenge, it can create space for 
new solutions to take root. Although growth in its current form has increased both emissions and 
inequality in the past, businesses, institutions, and governments can address these externalities 
more directly. 

For developing economies, the prospects for more people to exit poverty are inextricably 
linked to their ability to grow. These countries would need to double down on productivity, skill 
development, and technological leapfrogging.36 They may also need institutional reforms, from 
clearer legal frameworks for property rights to stronger oversight that prevents leakages of 
public spending.37 New collaborations may be needed to integrate low-income countries more 
fully into global flows of trade, finance, technology, and knowledge. 

The upside is compelling: higher growth and innovation could lead to some 600 million 
people moving out of poverty, taking significant steps on their journey toward full economic 
empowerment. Even in the absence of greater commitments and international transfers, growth 
and the actions of businesses can unlock real progress that changes lives. 

Innovation at scale is critical 
Relentlessly focusing on technology development is one of the keys to getting to net zero and 
lowering the price tag associated with doing so. The significant recent drops in the costs of wind 
and solar power offer reason for hope. R&D, learning by doing, and scaling up eventually drive 
costs down. The faster this happens, the lower the risk of households facing higher energy costs. 

On the inclusion side, innovation and technology adoption generate demand for higher skills and 
better jobs. Innovation is also needed to tap efficiency-boosting opportunities and bring down 
the costs (and prices) of basic needs, from housing and food to education and healthcare. 

Innovation is also needed in a broader sense. Lifting minimum living standards and containing 
climate change would involve sweeping transformations, requiring bold approaches in policy, 
finance, technology, and industry. The possibilities could include creating new multilateral 
financing vehicles; integrating low-income countries into global flows of capital and trade in 
a way that lifts local communities and small businesses; developing sustainable cities with

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthaffordable housing; strengthening education and healthcare systems worldwide; and designing 
effective carbon markets, including incentives for countries to preserve biodiversity and critical 
carbon sinks. 

Progress toward empowerment and net zero would depend on private actors, governments, and 
NGOs and nonprofits combining their capabilities and expertise—and thinking without limits 
about how they can contribute to meeting this moment. Regardless of whether countries fully 
close the gaps, they have real opportunities to build a more stable, prosperous future. 

We recognize the scope of these challenges as well as the political realities and the gravitational 
pull of the status quo. Financing is only one aspect of what would need to be done; achieving 
consensus and moving toward implementation would be incredibly complex. Countries that 
decide to take on these generational transformations would need an entirely different magnitude 
of public–private cooperation. The size of the challenge is not a reason for resignation; it is a call 
for everyone to roll up their sleeves on what can be done today. Every incremental step forward 
advances the continuum of progress.

1. Economic empowerment: 
Higher minimum living 
standards for everyone

In perhaps the biggest achievement of modern times, a billion people worldwide exited 
extreme poverty in the three decades preceding the pandemic—that is, their incomes surpassed 
the World Bank’s poverty line, set at $2.15 per day.38 While China and India account for the 
largest share of global poverty reduction, other developing countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, 
Tanzania, and Vietnam also achieved rapid gains.39 This progress has translated into tangible 
human development outcomes. Since 1990, mortality for children under age five has been 
reduced by almost 60 percent.40 Most children worldwide now have access to at least primary 
education. In the developing world, the average years of schooling completed more than tripled 
between 1950 and 2010, fueling dramatic increases in literacy rates.41

Amid this good news, poverty has remained stubbornly hard to erase in full. As of 2020, some 
730 million people were still in extreme poverty worldwide.42 Many of them struggle to afford 
food and survive. Extreme poverty remains a challenge in developing countries, but even in 
wealthier countries, the poorest segments of the population may face homelessness, lower life 
expectancy, and the inability to move in search of better jobs. 

The territory above the poverty line can also be a difficult place to thrive. An even bigger swath 
of the global population may not be formally counted as “poor” by the $2.15 metric or their own 
national poverty lines, but they are still unable to secure an economic foothold. They meet more 
of their essential needs than those in extreme poverty, but not across the board or to a sufficient 

38 The World Bank’s extreme poverty line was recently updated from $1.90 to $2.15 per person per day; the update also involved 

changing from 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) terms to 2017 PPP terms. Correcting course: Poverty and shared prosperity

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthdegree. Their lives might involve making do with very little and not having buffers to weather 
periods of hardship. Many are one emergency away from falling back into poverty.

Development experts and economists have discussed setting a higher bar for living standards, 
taking this cohort’s vulnerability into account. This higher bar does not undermine the goal of 
eliminating extreme poverty; it is a complementary benchmark that explores how to move toward 
a world in which people can realize more of their own potential.

For each country, we estimate the point at which a person has the means to afford the full range 
of simple basics plus a small measure of savings and the resources to make self-determined 
choices. This last point involves people having greater agency, echoing the UN Development 
Programme’s aspiration to “expand the sense of possibility in people’s lives.”43 This chapter 
defines the concept more fully and translates the current gap into concrete economic terms. 

Our analysis uses a 2021–30 time frame. The end date of 2030 is the target year of the 
Sustainable Development Goals, which include eliminating poverty and improving well-being 
for all ages, as well as 15 other inclusion- and sustainability-connected aims. While we do not 
explicitly model the SDGs, they are in sync with many of the objectives in this research. We chose 
a 2020 starting point in part because of data availability and also to provide a clear decade-long 
line of sight. Our results are broadly relevant for a 10-year horizon, not just anchored to these 
specific dates.

Universal empowerment lifts everyone to economic sufficiency 
To quantify what a higher bar for living standards could look like, we estimate an empowerment 
line for each country (Exhibit 1). It is a metric calibrated to ensure that everyone has the 
means to meet their essential needs, including food, housing and energy, safe water access, 
transportation, healthcare, education, clothing, and communication, with small margins for 
spending toward civic engagement (some minimum spending on recreation or community 
activities) and a savings buffer.44 The housing is likely a modest apartment; the transportation 
could be a transit pass, a used car, or perhaps a motorbike if that suffices in some contexts. But 
everyone is lifted to minimum acceptable living standards. 

Empowerment is the point at which people have the ability to start making real choices about 
discretionary purchases, which fuels market growth, and have the ability to invest in themselves, 
which builds their human capital. Beyond the economics, however, is an improved quality of life.

How we arrive at the empowerment line for different countries
We arrive at a unique empowerment threshold for each country, building on a rich body of 
literature on the topics of absolute and relative poverty. While the empowerment lines vary 
across countries, the concept remains the same: the means required to meet basic needs 
and have some degree of economic security. In 2020 US dollar terms, we estimate that such 
means range between $3 and $50 per capita per day across the countries in our data set.45 The 
empowerment line is about $3 per capita in countries like Afghanistan and Sudan; $4 to $5 in 

43 Human development report 2021–22: Uncertain times, unsettled lives: Shaping our future in a transforming world, UN 

Development Programme, September 2022.

44 This concept is rooted in earlier MGI research, which took a micro approach and quantified the cost of a basket of essential 
goods and services for households in India. See From poverty to empowerment: India’s imperative for jobs, growth, and 
effective basic services, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2014. The data set used in this research compiles the costs of 
essential goods (rather than the whole economy, which PPP indices measure). See Martin Guzi et al., Living wages and income 
worldwide, WageIndicator Foundation, 2023, and wageindicator.org.

45 Iceland and Switzerland are outliers on the upper end of the empowerment line range and above $50.

India, Indonesia, and Nigeria; $8 to $11 in China, Mexico, South Africa, and Thailand; $15 to $45 in 
Australia, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and Poland; and $50 in the United States.

To arrive at these figures, we start with a global floor, the minimum level of consumption needed 
in the lowest-income countries. This draws on research defining the level at which a person 
can meet basic needs and start to achieve discretionary consumption as $12 (in purchasing 
power parity, or PPP, terms) per person per day in developing countries.46 This is the point at 
which research suggests there is minimal risk of a person falling back into poverty.47 (For more 
on the research that informed our thinking and methodology, see Box E1, “Measuring economic 
inclusion,” in the executive summary.)

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthSecond, we raise the floor for countries at higher income levels, since some modest adjustments 
are needed for their residents to afford the quantity or quality of goods necessary to function 
(Exhibit 2). To do this, we use detailed 2022 and 2023 cost-of-living data from the WageIndicator 
Foundation for a basket of goods and services covering basic needs.48 (See the technical 
appendix for more on methodology.) The estimates we use are nationally representative, 
although we acknowledge significant within-country variations.49

48 The WageIndicator Foundation is a nonprofit that collects and shares data on wages and the cost of living globally in an effort to 

create labor market transparency and advocate for workers earning fair wages that enable them to lead decent lives.

49 We note that having one empowerment threshold for a given country does not reflect how housing and other costs vary from 

region to region within the country; it costs more to live an empowered life in an expensive major city than in a poorer rural area.

42

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthBecause we use a consumption-based metric to calibrate the empowerment line for each 
country, we compare the threshold to the consumption distribution in each country. This already 
accounts for taxes and direct transfers. But in-kind transfers also affect the empowerment 
threshold. Universal healthcare, for example, lowers out-of-pocket healthcare costs needed 
for individuals, while free public K–12 schools lower out-of-pocket education costs required 
for families. We use International Monetary Fund (IMF) and OECD data to adjust the global 
empowerment line floor for the estimated in-kind transfers that each country provides. This total 
is prorated to the share of the population below the empowerment line and then converted to 
a per-person, per-day figure. For countries above the global floor, the cost-of-living data from 
WageIndicator Foundation also takes such transfers into account. 

However, we acknowledge the lack of perfect certainty about how public services reach their 
targeted recipients, especially the poorest segments.50 Indeed, one way for countries to advance 
empowerment is through improvements in program design and execution to ensure that social 
benefit programs can be accessed by their intended beneficiaries, and that such transmission 
is accurately measured.51 We also note that empowerment is a per-person measure. Families 
that combine their resources would have better prospects for meeting their basic needs than 
individuals below this line living alone.  

Empowerment thresholds rise along with income levels, reflecting each country’s cost of living 
and context. Yet it is important to note that the definition of basic goods remains consistent 
across countries, creating a universal standard for building lives that no longer revolve around 
struggle and doing without. At this same time, we are able to account for relative differences in 
living standards and costs of living across countries of different income groups (Exhibit 3). 

This approach recognizes the very real economic insecurity that persists even in most of the 
world’s wealthy countries, along with the need to make faster progress in the developing 
world. At the empowerment line, everyone would have the means to afford the essentials within 
their own context as well as start to save for the future. For the most part, the empowerment 
thresholds in developing countries are above current median consumption levels; in high-income 
countries, they are below the median.

In both high- and low-income countries, we view empowerment as the point at which people can 
begin to invest in themselves and make choices about issues such as where they live and what 
paths they will pursue as workers and consumers. Defining economic sufficiency as the point 
at which discretionary choices can be made echoes Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s assertions 
that income alone does not reflect well-being. Economic empowerment conveys capabilities, 
including the freedom to enjoy life and individual agency.52

What does it mean to live below the empowerment line?
As of 2020, about 4.7 billion people worldwide (approximately 60 percent of the global 
population) were not yet fully economically empowered. Some 4.4 billion of them lived in  
low- and middle-income countries, while 300 million people were in high-income countries.

the empowerment line. 

Their experience has many different faces depending on an individual’s distance from that line 
(Exhibit 4). The poorest segments meet less than 20 percent of their essential needs. There are 
some 850 million such people globally (including all those in extreme poverty), with the majority 
in sub-Saharan Africa and India. They may be subsistence farmers and live far from the nearest 
medical clinic, with no digital networks and even a lack of clean drinking water. The urban poor 
among them may live in slums or shantytowns. 

An additional 1.9 billion people globally are not in such extreme circumstances, but they lack the 
means to meet more than half of their basic needs. In high-income countries, they may live in rural 
areas with entrenched poverty and few job opportunities, or they may crowd into small apartments 
in unsafe urban neighborhoods, with little privacy or few quiet spots for children to study.  

Yet another 1.9 billion are closer to the empowerment line and may have some of the calling cards 
of minimum acceptable living standards, but they remain vulnerable. They may own a TV, a basic

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthmobile phone, and a used car, for example, but living paycheck to paycheck demands a constant 
financial balancing act. This segment typically lacks savings to cushion against emergencies or 
build a more secure retirement. MGI’s own past work showed that the lower two quintiles of the 
population in advanced economies struggle to achieve savings and security.53

Housing is a major issue for most people living below the empowerment line. They may have to 
accept poorly maintained housing, take on longer daily commutes, crowd too many people into 
small spaces, or pay rent that strains their monthly budget. Previous MGI research estimated that 
the global affordable housing gap affects one in three urban residents worldwide.54 In the United 
States, for example, about 30 percent of households spend more than 30 percent of their income 
on housing; less than 40 percent of households in the lowest quintile of income earners own any 
equity in their home.55

Healthcare is another important component of empowerment; this involves both access and 
financial risk protection from hardship for the cost of care.56 It takes sufficient and sustained 
financing, and a major focus on primary care, to keep healthcare systems equitable and resilient. 
But disparities in access to quality care are evident in the varying health outcomes across 
countries and across population segments within countries. The gap between low- and high-
income countries in life expectancy is 18 years, for example.57 In India, there is an eight-year 
difference in average life expectancy between the lowest and highest income quintiles.58

Another aspect of living below the empowerment line is inadequate access to quality education. 
In some parts of the world, cost of basic education remains a problem: in much of Africa, for 
example, the cost of school fees prevents some children from enrolling.59 Then there is the 
challenge of delivering quality affordable education. Many developing countries have expanded 
primary and secondary schools but struggle to ensure that teachers are well trained and 
curricula are effective. Without improvements in access, quality, and affordability, the next 
generation could enter adulthood ill-equipped to participate in the modern global economy. 

Full economic empowerment, by contrast, would give people the tools they need to shape and 
improve circumstances for themselves and their families. That could include enrolling children in 
better schools, providing them with books and enrichment experiences, and creating pathways 
to higher education. It could also involve adults moving to places with better job opportunities or 
continuing their education to add skills for more fulfilling careers.

sufficiency and security. It is the cumulative step-up in spending over 2020 levels that would take 
everyone to the threshold in 2030, after accounting for government transfers.

The global empowerment gap is just over $37 trillion, cumulative over the decade. On an average 
annual basis, the gap is equivalent to about 40 percent of this population’s 2020 levels of 
spending. Of course, the size of the gap depends on the threshold selected and the target time 
frame over which the higher level is achieved. Lowering the threshold or allowing this trajectory 
to play out over a longer time frame would produce different results. 

Our analysis starts with actual spending in 2020 and assumes that people below the 
empowerment line gain a bit more spending power each year through 2030.60 In 2025, for 
example, their spending is assumed to reach 50 percent of the empowerment line.61 Closing this 
gap implies a steeper rise for the poorest segments and a more gradual one for the population 
starting closer to the empowerment line. 

The size of the gap by region
The magnitude of the empowerment gap varies widely across regions, reflecting different 
starting points. In high-income regions, including the EU, Japan, and the United States, the gap 
is equivalent to 1 percent of GDP each year (Exhibit 5). For China, it’s 2 percent of GDP, on an 
annual average basis to 2030. 

But in many parts of the developing world, the starting point is harder, since large populations are 
much further away from the line. The gap is 6 percent of GDP annually in Asia (outside of China, 
India, and Japan), 7 percent in Latin America, 13 percent in India—and a daunting 45 percent in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Again, this is a product of how we have set the line. If the threshold were 
set 50 percent lower, India’s gap would be 3 percent of GDP and sub-Saharan Africa’s would be 
16 percent of GDP.

60 All calculations are relative to the empowerment gap in 2020; we chose not to adjust this line over time with development levels. 
In reality, the threshold will rise as a country develops, so China and other countries could still have populations below a new 
and higher threshold in 2030 (although by 2020 standards, the gap will be closed). This research focuses on closing today’s 
gaps rather than on projecting the size of future gaps.

61 The difference between estimated annual spending per capita for people below the empowerment threshold relative to the 
target for that year is the annual gap. The final empowerment gap figure is the sum of the annual gaps over the next decade.

Making progress toward empowerment is important for both  
individuals and societies 
The empowerment gap is large, but making steady progress toward closing it matters. At a 
societal level, empowerment is correlated with positive human development outcomes ranging 
from reduced childhood mortality and longer life expectancy to additional years of schooling 
and expanded digital and financial inclusion. For individuals, life satisfaction improves when 
people can shed the stress of not being able to make ends meet and fulfill more of their 
material desires.62

If every household were fully empowered to meet its basic needs by 2030, all children could 
grow up healthier, more educated, and more globally connected. Importantly, they would have 
the tools for advancement. By 2050, the global generation coming into adulthood would be 
equipped to fulfill its potential. This intergenerational perspective matters, since growing up with 
better health and nutrition, higher-quality education, the ability to buffer shocks, and a more

States and found that increases in life satisfaction rose along with income growth up to $75,000 annually. See also Andrew T.

well-being over a lifetime.63

The aspiration to give the next generation a better starting point is urgent not only from a 
humanitarian perspective but also from an economic one. A large body of academic literature 
has established that investing in children yields enormous economic and societal benefits.64 
The world will need many more educated, empowered adults in the decades ahead to achieve 
broad-based prosperity. Already, as populations age in many parts of the world, labor forces 
are shrinking, requiring new ways to encourage participation and raise productivity. Meanwhile, 
the expanding knowledge economy needs workers with more technological and cognitive skills, 
while automation and artificial intelligence are increasingly displacing routine work. Universal 
empowerment would equip many more people with the skills and agency to participate in a more 
knowledge-intensive economy.

Inaction also poses risks to societies. The discontent associated with poverty and hunger—
now potentially exacerbated by the effects of climate change—can lead to instability.65 For 
billions of people, reaching empowerment is the existential issue. Since the net-zero transition 
requires broad public support, there is even more urgency to prioritize empowerment 
alongside sustainability. If people feel that investment to address the climate agenda is 
crowding out their prospects for a better life, popular pressure could build for countries to opt 
out of the effort altogether. 

In our systems view of the economy, empowerment is inextricably linked to growth and 
sustainability—and the clock is ticking on the latter. The following chapters will define the 
investment and spending needed in this decade to get on a path to reach net-zero emissions, 
then outline how growth and other avenues for action could move the world closer to achieving 
both goals.

2. The net-zero investment need

Climate change is an urgent, generational problem. And while it is not the only element 
of sustainability, climate science tells us that as average temperatures rise globally, acute 
environmental hazards such as heat waves and floods would increase in both frequency and 
severity in parts of the world, while chronic conditions such as heat and rising sea levels also 
intensify.66 At current emissions levels, the world could deplete its “carbon budget” for limiting 
warming to 1.5°C relative to preindustrial levels by the end of the current decade; if CO₂ emissions 
exceed that envelope, warming would be pushed higher.67

This is a decisive decade for altering the world’s path on emissions. Reaching net-zero emissions, 
as many countries have pledged to do, involves transforming energy and land-use systems.68 
It would change how we power, cool, and heat our homes; how we get around; how we create 
goods and produce our food; and how we approach many other aspects of life and work.  

This research focuses on one specific element of that journey: the need for a massive infusion of 
capital (see Box 1, “Requirements to reach net-zero emissions,” for a more detailed overview of other 
elements). In a scenario of accelerated economic growth (an important driver of empowerment), low-
emissions investment and spending would need to total $55 trillion, cumulative over the decade—a 
major increase of $41 trillion relative to 2020 spending levels.69 The incremental investment need 
is roughly equivalent to 4 percent of global GDP annually. It would go toward assets that deliver 
renewable power and other low-emissions sources of energy as well as electric vehicles, to name just 

66 Climate change 2021: The physical science basis: Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report, 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2021; Noah S. Diffenbaugh and Christopher B. Field, “Changes in 
ecologically critical terrestrial climate conditions,” Science, volume 341, number 6145, August 2013; Seth D. Burgess, Samuel 
Bowring, and Shu-zhong Shen, “High-precision timeline for Earth’s most severe extinction,” Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, volume 111, number 9, March 2014.

67 As of 2020, the IEA estimated about 33.9 Gt of annual CO2 emissions from the energy system and 5–6 Gt of annual CO2 

emissions from land-use systems. In the IPCC 2021 annual report, the authors found that the residual global carbon budget to 
remain within 1.5°C warming with 67 percent probability was 400 Gt. Therefore, from this report’s effective measurement start 
date of 2020, the climate budget to limit warming to 1.5°C (assuming constant emissions) would run out in roughly 10 years, or 
around the end of 2030.  

68 The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could bring, McKinsey Global Institute, January 2022.
69 This includes spending for low-emissions physical assets across various forms of energy supply (for example, renewable power 
systems, hydrogen, and biofuel supply), energy demand (for example, for vehicles and alternate methods of steel and cement 
production), and various forms of land use (for example, greenhouse gas–efficient farming practices). This includes both what 
is typically considered investment in national accounts and, in some cases, spending on consumer durables such as personal 
cars. We often refer to this spending as “investment” while acknowledging that it also includes categories of consumer 
durables. We typically consider spending to replace physical assets at the point of emissions (for example, cars for mobility); 
additional spending would also occur through the value chain. To minimize double counting, we have not sized this spending. 
We use a 2020 starting point to give a clear decade-long line of sight and because the Network for Greening the Financial 
System’s scenarios, which provide the basis for our analysis, include actual, historical data for energy use only up to 2020. 
(Based on clean energy investment in 2021 and 2022, the scale of investment still needed by 2030 has not shifted dramatically 
since 2020.)

51

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growtha few priorities. For context, if the world continued investing in low-emissions assets at constant 2020 
levels through the decade, it would get to a cumulative total of only about $14 trillion. 

This research considers the emissions reduction needed in this decade to put the world on a 
path to global net zero by 2050, focusing on areas that account for 85 percent of all greenhouse 
gas emissions across countries.70 Our analysis builds on a scenario to reach net zero and limit 
warming to 1.5°C from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).71 Much more would 
be needed beyond 2030, but our focus is on the near-term steps over the decade that would lead 
to a broader net-zero trajectory.

We emphasize that our estimates are not predictions or forecasts but rather the product 
of scenarios, which are always subject to some uncertainty, particularly in an emerging 
field of research. Some of these unknown factors include the world’s warming pathway; 
the decarbonization methods and actual activity levels within each sector; the evolution of 
technology costs through innovation; and the availability of input materials which could affect 
these costs, to name a few. All of these variables could affect the capital investment needed for 
the transition. Our findings are estimates meant to illustrate the magnitude of the challenge and 
its dimensions across sectors and geographies. See the technical appendix for a more detailed 
discussion of our methodology and data sources.

A net-zero trajectory requires a $41 trillion step-up in low-emissions  
investment, cumulative through 2030
We quantify the necessary step-up in low-emissions investment and spending above 2020 
levels, cumulative through 2030, needed in a scenario that will get the world to net zero by 2050. 
To arrive at this figure, we have undertaken a detailed, bottom-up exercise, examining a long list 
of low-emissions technologies and their potential deployment across sectors and countries.72

We start with 2020 spending on low-emissions assets like wind and solar energy generation, 
electric vehicles, and heating for buildings. All of this totaled about $1.4 trillion per year, or 
1.7 percent of global GDP. In 2021 and 2022, clean energy investment grew only about 15 to 
30 percent above 2020 levels—well below the nearly 300 percent average annual increases 

70 Specifically, we quantify the capital expenditures needed for shifting energy use in the power, mobility, buildings, and industry 
systems away from fossil fuels; establishing the infrastructure required for the transition; adopting low-emissions agricultural 
processes; ramping up the production of low-emissions fuels, both hydrogen- and biomass-based; and increasing the volumes 
of carbon capture, via afforestation and the deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies. Our investment 
analysis excludes some industries (e.g., aluminum, chemicals); non-road mobility (since road transportation accounts for 75 
percent of the emissions in this sector); and waste and measures like circular economy. More abatement is possible in these areas.

71 See Box E2, “Measuring the net-zero investment need,” in the executive summary, for more on methodology. The Net Zero 

2050 scenario from NGFS assumes that governments enact strong climate policies, technological innovation proceeds at a 
rapid pace, and carbon removal is widely practiced. It reaches net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050 for the economy as a whole; this 
means there are some residual gross emissions in hard-to-abate sectors and regions, but they are offset by CO₂ removals. This 
ultimately limits warming to only 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. This is in line with the net-zero aspiration we frame in this paper. 
We adjust NGFS scenarios for baseline and accelerated growth.

72 Our analysis divides high-emissions assets from low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure. Low-emissions assets 

have a relatively low emissions footprint; the term does not always mean carbon neutral. This segmentation allows us to size the 
step-up needed for the specific technologies that help the world achieve net-zero emissions.  In doing so, we recognize that the 
demarcation between high- and low-emissions levers is not always clear. Low-emissions assets and enabling infrastructure 
include assets for blue-hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage (CCS); low-emissions hydrogen production 
using electricity and biomass; biofuel production; electricity generation using wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, and geothermal 
power, as well as relying on biomass and gas with CCS; electricity transmission and distribution and storage infrastructure; 
heat production from low-emissions sources such as biomass; electric arc steel furnaces using scrap or hydrogen-fueled direct 
reduced iron (DRI), as well as basic oxygen furnaces with CCS; cement kilns with biomass or fossil-fuel kilns with CCS; battery 
electric and other low-emissions vehicles and supporting infrastructure; heating equipment for buildings run on electricity 
or biomass, including heat pumps; district heating exchangers and connections; cooking technology not relying on fossil 
fuels; building insulation; low-emissions production methods for crops, including reliance on bio-fertilizers and on anaerobic 
digesters; low-emissions techniques for dairy and livestock management, including use of nitrogen inhibitors and feed 
additives reducing cattle emissions; and afforestation.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthneeded to reach a net-zero pathway by 2030.73 Therefore, the scale of investment still needed by 
2030 has not shifted dramatically since 2020.

If we assume baseline global GDP growth of roughly 2.7 percent annually, spending on low-emissions 
assets would need to total roughly $51 trillion, cumulative over the decade. This would be a step-
up of roughly $37 trillion as compared with simply extending current levels of spending over the 
decade. This increase is equal to 3.6 percent of global GDP on average annually to the next decade. 

However, this research focuses on a scenario in which the world achieves even higher 
productivity-driven growth of 3.4 percent globally, a critical driver of incomes and broader 
prosperity. But there’s a catch: higher growth means higher production, which ultimately requires 
greater inputs of energy and physical capital. 

Accelerated economic growth increases the total net-zero investment need to about $55 trillion 
(Exhibit 6). On top of continuing current levels of spending, this would be a step-up of $41 trillion, 
cumulative through the end of the decade.74 That is equivalent to just under 4 percent of global 
GDP on average each year. We refer to this incremental increase as the net-zero investment gap.

It is important to note that these figures do not reflect high-emissions investment. In the 
scenario modeled here, some high-emissions investment continues but at falling levels 
globally, while low-emissions investment needs to rise to about four times its current levels in 
the next decade. 

In addition, our research does not explore the continued increases in low-emissions 
investment and spending needed after 2030. After 2030, high-emissions investment would 
continue decreasing in this scenario, eventually hitting a low annual average of $700 billion 
from 2046 to 2050. Meanwhile, low-emissions investment would continue increasing through 
the early 2040s, incrementally decreasing only in the final several years of the decade. 

This is a decisive decade for altering 
the world’s emissions trajectory. 
Getting to net zero by 2050 will 
involve transforming energy and 
land-use systems worldwide.

and it focuses on the period through 2030, rather than the full period through 2050. It also includes updated and refined 
assumptions, for example, refined views of unit capital costs and improved data for 2020 levels of spend.

The net-zero spending need breaks down differently across sectors  
In the scenario modeled for the current decade, mobility accounts for more than one-third of 
the net-zero investment gap, or $14.7 trillion (Exhibit 7). Our analysis focuses only on passenger 
and commercial vehicles in road mobility, which produce three-quarters of mobility emissions 
(although addressing aviation, rail, and shipping as well could further reduce overall emissions).75 
Bringing down the emissions associated with road mobility involves shifting to electric vehicles 
(powered by either batteries or fuel cells) across cars, buses, and light and heavy trucks; it 
also involves building the charging infrastructure needed to power these vehicles. Battery 
electric and fuel cell electric vehicle (BEV and FCEV) cars would play a key role, with their stock 
increasing from around 10 million in 2020 to more than 450 million in 2030. They account for 

75 Two- and three-wheelers are excluded from this analysis because of the wide range of estimates on today’s stock and 

penetration. Including them would create a high degree of uncertainty.

roughly three-quarters of the spending need in mobility, with all of the remainder going to low-
emission commercial mobility and infrastructure build-up.

An additional third of the cumulative gap (about $14 trillion) relates to needs in the power sector.76 
Almost any decarbonization trajectory involves a massive increase in electrification, with power

the largest total investment need over the decade. However, it also has a higher current level of spending than mobility, which 
means that the gap, or necessary step-up, in mobility is larger.

Requirements to reach net-zero emissions

To achieve net-zero emissions, previous 
McKinsey research identified fundamental 
system-level requirements that fall into the 
following three categories:1 

 — Physical building blocks. While there 
is a line of sight to the technologies 
needed to limit warming to 1.5°C above 
preindustrial levels, further innovation 
is needed to continue developing new 
technologies that can be deployed 
at scale and to reduce costs. Supply 
chains would need to be built out to 
support new technology deployment; 
this would require not only significant 
capital and the right capabilities but 
also extensive coordination. Necessary 

natural resources, including copper, 
nickel, rare earth metals, land, and 
water, would also need to be carefully 
managed to minimize bottlenecks and 
prevent price spikes and inflation.

 — Economic and societal adjustments. 

An orderly transition to net zero 
would require significant changes to 
where and how capital gets allocated.

new governing standards, tracking 
and market mechanisms, and effective 
institutions. Securing an orderly 
transition will require leaders to develop

is also unlikely to occur without the 
support of citizens and consumers,  
and in some cases, consumers may

to reduce their own emissions.

provided from low-emissions sources. This requires transforming generation and storage 
systems, as well as expanding transmission and distribution (T&D). Infrastructure (including both 
utility-scale storage and T&D) accounts for around 10 percent of the $41 trillion scale-up needed 
for a successful transition. Particularly high spending is required in emerging economies, which 
have to expand their power systems and ensure they can keep pace with rapid growth while 
undertaking the transition. China, for instance, accounts for more than a quarter of the global 
investment need in T&D, while India has higher needs than all of the European Union and United 
Kingdom. In the NGFS Net Zero by 2050 scenario, 70 percent of global electricity would be 
generated via renewables by 2030. Solar and wind would account for almost half of generation 
volumes by that date—a sharp increase from their 8 percent share in 2020.

About 20 percent of the gap would go toward equipping and retrofitting commercial and 
residential buildings with cleaner heating and cooking units, particularly the former. This primarily 
consists of spending on heat pumps in the scenario modeled here, with significant spending 
on retrofits and district heating as well. The stock of heat pumps would need to increase by five 
times in the current decade.

The four other sectors combine for less than 15 percent of the net-zero investment gap. 
Agriculture accounts for about 60 percent of this, with $3 trillion needed to promote wider

livestock.77 The three other sectors (forestry, industry, and hydrogen) would require smaller 
increases. In forestry, the need is for planting and expanding forests as well as avoiding 
deforestation. Industry is a unique case. It has a relatively small investment need in the current 
decade because decarbonizing heavy industry will rely on technologies that are not expected 
to reach full commercial maturity until around the end of the decade; the scale of investment 
needed in this decade is therefore relatively low. For instance, even in 2030, only about 
25 percent of cement is projected to be produced using low-emissions technologies.

The size of the gap that would need to be bridged to get on a net-zero  
pathway varies by region
The sectors and systems described above have unique footprints across regions. Each region 
therefore has its own investment need and would allocate it differently (Exhibit 8).

emissions include using anaerobic digestors, feed additives, and nitrogen inhibitors to reduce cattle-related emissions.

Each region’s net-zero investment gap 
needs to be viewed not only in absolute 
terms but also in relative terms.

Mobility requires low-emissions investment and spending in many high-income economies. It 
accounts for more than 40 percent of the investment gap in Australia, Canada, Europe, and New 
Zealand, for example. Among other things, this reflects the large price discrepancy between 
zero-emissions vehicles in high-income countries versus emerging economies, as well as the 
larger share of car ownership. 

Power is a bigger slice of the net-zero investment gap across Asia and Africa than in the rest of 
the world. In fact, the sector represents about 30 percent of the gap in higher-income economies 
on average, but 45 percent in developing countries. While most regions will need to expand their 
power sectors to accommodate electrification, the extent of the scale-up is larger in developing 
economies. According to the NGFS Net Zero scenario, higher-income regions are projected to 
increase electricity generation by approximately 10 percent in the current decade, compared to 
roughly 25 percent in developing economies. India and sub-Saharan Africa need expansions of 
more than 60 percent. This drives higher T&D spending in emerging economies compared to high-
income ones—in the former, it represents around 15 percent of the total net-zero investment need, 
while in the latter it is around 10 percent.  In addition, most developing economies also need to grow 
renewable generation fourfold, compared to a threefold increase in high-income regions.78

The investment required for low-emissions agriculture is higher in regions where agriculture 
accounts for a bigger share of GDP. The largest gap is in Latin America, which is one of the 
world’s breadbaskets for staple crops such as grains and is also a major producer of livestock.79 
The second-highest share is needed in sub-Saharan Africa, where agriculture employs more 
than half of the workforce.80

Finally, each region’s total net-zero investment gap needs to be viewed not only in absolute levels 
but also in relative terms. The United States, for example, would need to boost low-emissions 
spending by $7.4 trillion, cumulative over the decade, or 3 percent of its GDP annually in an 
accelerated growth scenario. 

Meanwhile, India’s net-zero investment gap looks smaller in absolute terms, at a total value of 
$5.6 trillion (nearly $2 trillion less than the United States over the decade). However, that gap 
represents 14 percent of the country’s GDP this decade with accelerated growth, a ninefold 
increase from 2020 levels of low-emissions spending, which makes India the country with the 
steepest relative hill to climb by far. By the same token, sub-Saharan Africa is the geography 
with the smallest absolute gap to bridge. This is because the region has a relatively small 
energy-system emissions footprint today and a slower transition compared with other regions.81 

78 China and Latin America are an exception to this trend, as they already have a large share of renewable generation as of 2020, 

which reduces the need for further build-up (to 30 percent for China and 60 percent for Latin America).

in India.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthBut relatively low 2020 investment levels mean that it would need to muster a bigger factor 
increase than higher-income geographies with higher levels of current low-emissions capital 
expenditures, like Japan and China. 

Achieving net zero by 2050 in typical transition scenarios would entail decisive action in this 
decade. After all, it takes time to transform energy systems—and then even more time for the 
benefits to manifest. Sizing and mapping the net-zero investment need leads to the next big 
questions: where can such large sums come from, and who could pay? The following chapter will 
discuss the role of growth and other avenues for action; chapter 5 will then take a step-by-step 
approach examining how far each of these avenues can take us toward a net-zero trajectory.

3. A systems view showing 
the role of growth 

Sustainability, inclusion, and growth are often viewed as independent objectives. In reality, 
they can—and must—progress together. The economy is an interconnected system. Moving one 
cog makes other cogs turn, and the machine works smoothly only if all the gears pull together. 

Why do we assess this system against not just one but two goals of historic magnitude, and 
through the lens of what is possible in this decade? Business leaders and policy makers 
worldwide understand the urgency of acting now to get on track for net-zero emissions by 2050. 
But at the same time, they are grappling with meeting society’s broader expectations. 

For billions of people in their roles as citizens, consumers, and workers, living standards and job 
opportunities are the primary concern. People need to see their own lives getting better and 
to feel that their children have prospects to go even further. Since broadening prosperity and 
tackling climate change are contemporaneous challenges, with synergies and counteractions, 
they need to be viewed and tackled in tandem. The net-zero transition needs broad public 
support and participation, which could erode if people feel that their hopes are being postponed 
because of it. Leaving large segments behind could also have generational consequences by 
limiting growth, risking social stability, and wasting human potential. 

Our research applies the same urgency to both economic empowerment and net-zero 
investment in this decisive decade to provide a fact base for decision making. The time frame is 
intentional. At today’s level of emissions, the world’s carbon budget for holding to a 1.5°C path is 
trending toward running out around the end of the decade.82 In addition, 2030 is the target for 
the Sustainable Development Goals.  

Economic growth is essential for both aspirations (Exhibit 9). Visionary goals, whether for 
sustainability or inclusion, are more likely to be pursued when the pie is growing and put aside 
when it is shrinking. Growth lifts incomes and raises living standards. It unlocks the financing 
capacity needed for a net-zero future. While growth can’t overcome every structural challenge, it 
can create space for new solutions to emerge and take root.

82 We use a 2020 starting point to give a clear decade-long view of potential progress. In addition, NGFS scenarios, the basis 

for our sustainability analysis, use 2020 as their starting point. Based on investment in low-emissions assets and increases in 
empowerment in 2021 and 2022, the scale of spending needed this decade has not dramatically shifted.

Growth in its current form has not delivered sufficiency to everyone and has been contributing 
to increased emissions for decades. If these externalities were directly addressed, it could be 
possible to achieve a virtuous cycle (see Box 2, “To grow, or not to grow? That is the debate.”). 
Advancing inclusion and getting to net zero would ultimately reinforce growth by reducing the 
physical risks and costs of climate change, strengthening societal stability, expanding economic 
choice, and preparing the next generation with the skills needed to be productive. The whole 
system would be stronger and more resilient.

This chapter introduces our frameworks, which explore the extent to which growth and 
innovation can close the empowerment and net-zero investment gaps (explored in turn and in 
more detail in chapters 4 and 5). After accounting for these forces, substantial unfilled gaps 

62

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthremain; this tees up questions we return to in chapter 6. Finally, this chapter explores some of 
the interactions in this interconnected system, including some risks and tensions that would 
need to be managed.

Box 2

To grow, or not to grow? That is the debate.

Is economic growth, with its emphasis 
on producing and consuming ever-larger 
quantities of material goods, harming the 
planet? Or could it be part of the solution 
for saving it? 

This debate has been ongoing for some 
years now, with the looming threat of 
climate change causing some academics 
to make the case for “degrowth.” Among 
them is economic anthropologist Jason 
Hickel, who paints the pursuit of growth 
as a race to ecological disaster and does 
not believe that technological innovation 
alone can head off climate change. He 
also asserts that high-income countries 
don’t need more growth in order to 
improve people’s lives, calling for their 
economies to be reorganized around 
well-being, pulling back on excess 
energy and resource use.1 The world, 
with its finite resources, cannot continue 
aiming for continuous growth, according 
to physicist and former US Energy 
Secretary Steven Chu, who argued that 
“you have to design an economy based on 
no growth or even shrinking growth.”2

Other scholars do not go quite so far, 
instead making the case that slower 

growth is compatible with prosperity,  
at least for high-income economies. They 
envision a different model of growth that 
stays within environmental limits and has 
a stronger emphasis on shared prosperity 
and providing essential services.3 Yet 
the global system is interconnected: 
consumption in high-income economies 
creates the markets for the export-
oriented economies of Asia that have 
lifted so many out of poverty.4

Another school of thought defends 
economic growth. Benjamin Friedman 
argues that it creates increasingly 
“moral” societies, with rising prosperity 
for most, along with greater tolerance, 
more robust democracies, and a stronger 
safety net for the most disadvantaged. 
As long as households feel their quality 
of life improving over time, they are less 
concerned with how others are doing 
and more inclined to be generous to 
those left behind. Friedman cautions 
that stagnation invites a fight for scarce 
resources and retrenchment. In other 
words, growth can drive progress on 
inclusion, well-being, and economic 
mobility—provided it is broad-based.5 
Major societal endeavors, such as  

the push to get to net zero, are more  
likely to win public buy-in when the pie  
is expanding. 

The net-zero transition depends on fueling 
a burst of technological innovation, which 
is funded by growth and fueled by the 
aspiration to capture even more growth 
in the future. Economist Alessio Terzi 
observes that much of the world’s R&D 
machinery is inextricably tied to private-
sector activity and the incentives that 
economic rewards provide. He notes that 
market forces have not addressed carbon 
emissions because they are not priced 
and argues that changing this can harness 
these forces in service of the transition. 
In societies where this is politically 
infeasible, regulation is an indirect way to 
increase the price of carbon. Terzi argues 
that growth is necessary, but so too is a 
reckoning with the legitimate discontents 
and criticisms of the anti-growth 
movement. Societies have to resolve the 
tensions between unchecked market 
forces, environmental sustainability, and 
the need for prosperity to reach those who 
have been left behind.6

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthBox 2 (continued)

To grow, or not to grow? That is the debate.

Advocates of green growth hold that it 
is possible to keep economies growing 
while advancing sustainability. Some 
economists have predicted that it is 
possible to “decouple” GDP growth and 
carbon emissions, a path made more 
promising by the steep decline in the price 
of renewables.7 Indeed, some high-income 
economies have begun to achieve this.8

Our own analysis finds that growth is the 
most important force driving inclusion. 
More than 60 percent of the empowerment 
gap can be closed in a scenario of 
accelerated growth, which creates better-
paying jobs that lower the public finance 
burden for inclusion while simultaneously 
creating more tax revenue that can be 
deployed. That extra economic growth 

does increase the net-zero investment 
need, but it also increases the financing 
capacity to address it. Indeed, it is hard 
to imagine how countries can muster the 
immense step-up in capital investment 
required for the net-zero transition in the 
absence of growth. 

7  See, for example, Esther Sanyé-Mengual et al., “Assessing the decoupling of economic growth from environmental impacts in the European Union: A consumption-based 

approach,” Journal of Cleaner Production, volume 236, November 2019.

8  Hannah Ritchie, “Many countries have decoupled economic growth from CO2 emissions, even if we take offshored production into account,” Our World in Data, December 

2021; and Qiang Wang and Shasha Wang, “Decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions growth in the United States: The role of research and development,” Journal 
of Cleaner Production, volume 234, October 2019.

We consider how much growth and innovation can deliver on both fronts 
Reaching the goals outlined in chapters 1 and 2 for sustainability and inclusion involves 
considerable step-ups from 2020 spending levels. It would require channeling roughly 8 percent 
of global GDP toward these goals each year.  

Where could such substantial resources come from? To answer this, we estimate the potential 
contributions that could originate from various sources and forces, with particular attention to 
how much growth and business-led innovation can deliver (Exhibit 10). The numbers attached 
here are the product of macroeconomic modeling combined with detailed bottom-up analysis of 
costs and opportunities.83

Growth and business-led innovation 
Economic growth is an essential prerequisite if the world is to marshal resources of such 
magnitude. We find that growth and business-led innovation can contribute to meeting 
approximately half of the combined gaps. Businesses can further both goals and harness 
profitable opportunities as they do so.

Baseline growth
We start with a baseline scenario from Oxford Economics assuming GDP growth that averages 
about 2.7 percent globally on aggregate, varying by country. We then calculate how investment 
and spending related to empowerment and net zero would increase from actual 2020 levels in 
line with that growth. 

Baseline growth alone creates slow but steady progress toward eliminating poverty and raising 
living standards over time. This momentum can fill more than a third of the empowerment gap. It 
also generates tax revenue, creating resources to fund social safety nets. 

83 The analysis presented here is not a projection or a prediction. Instead, it is a scenario-based analysis of how specific 

empowerment and sustainability goals could be financed. For the latter, our starting point is the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario.

Note: This is not a projection or prediction but rather a scenario analyzing how specific empowerment levels and net-zero investments could occur. For the 
empowerment line, our starting point is a global floor of $12 PPP of consumption per capita per day, based on academic research. For net-zero investments, our 
starting point is the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Net Zero 2050 scenario using REMIND-MAgPIE (phase 2), modified for a higher-growth 
scenario. Our estimates include the necessary low-emissions spending on energy- and land-use systems and exclude high-emissions spending. Assumptions 
about policies and current commitments are as of 2021, reflecting the NGFS scenario.

However, baseline growth alone (not incorporating any technological advancement or 
switching from high- to low-emissions investment) makes a smaller contribution to closing the 
net-zero investment gap. The current level of investment in low-emissions assets is far too low 
to get to net zero. Maintaining it only in line with modest GDP growth would not deliver all the 
infrastructure and low-emissions technologies required. 

Business-led innovation: The power of productivity
Even under current market frameworks, the private sector has opportunities and incentives 
to advance inclusion and sustainability faster than a scenario of baseline growth suggests. 
Pushing for higher productivity is in every enterprise’s interest—and higher productivity 

65

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthcan raise wages and give consumers more spending power (both from wages and from the 
development of better-quality products and services). 

By scaling up opportunities from the micro-level across farm and non-farm sectors, our prior 
MGI research suggests the potential to raise productivity by at least 0.5 to 1.0 percent each 
year across regions, at an aggregate level.84 This is not only about cost-saving efficiencies; 
it is also about innovation and new business creation, new types of work, and products and 
services that address new markets. If global growth could reach 3.4 percent annually by 
harnessing such opportunities, more resources would also become available for public goods 
and social spending.

How could this unfold? Our previous research suggests the potential for advanced 
technologies, including automation, to diffuse well beyond firms at the frontier and into 
traditional sectors and small and medium-size enterprises.85 Recent breakthroughs in 
generative AI, in particular, show remarkable potential to boost labor productivity.86 In much of 
the world, democratizing access to technology and finance and harnessing the power of data 
can yield major productivity gains, especially in the informal sector, for agricultural producers, 
and for small businesses. In developing countries, capital deepening in infrastructure, 
construction, and export-oriented manufacturing and services can boost opportunities for 
higher growth and more gainful work.87

Is hoping for a burst of productivity realistic after a prolonged period of lackluster performance 
globally? We note that the accelerated growth projection in our analysis is not a forecast; 
instead, it is a scenario meant to illustrate the benefits and importance of higher productivity 
growth. However, there are real avenues to achieving it. Remarkable technology advances 
have not turbocharged productivity growth over the past two decades. One possible 
explanation—and reason to hope for the future—is that it takes time, organizational changes, 
and complementary innovations for the full impact of fundamental technologies to manifest.88

As companies adopt new technologies and push for higher productivity, they create new— 
and often better-paying—jobs. This is one of the biggest engines of empowerment in our 
modeling. Employer-led training and upskilling is a vital part of this dynamic. Yet it will 
require innovation and commitment on the part of businesses to redeploy workers into new 
opportunities at scale in the face of rapid technological change in developing and advanced 
economies alike. 

On the net-zero side, the world’s R&D machinery needs to be fully trained on the goal of 
making low-emissions technologies cheaper. Technology advances play an important role

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthin accelerating learning rates.89 In addition, deployment would further help to drive down 
costs. As a result, more spending and investment would become attractive for private actors, 
reducing the relative need for subsidies. Relentlessly focusing on technology development is 
one of the keys to not only getting to net zero but also lowering the price tag associated with 
doing so. All told, our estimates suggest some $15 trillion of the $41 trillion net-zero investment 
gap could occur, even without changes to the policy frameworks that existed in 2020. The 
majority, some $9 trillion, could consist of spending by private actors on low-emissions 
technologies that are becoming cost-competitive with traditional alternatives.  

Our analysis, presented in greater detail in chapter 5, shows that affordability is critical. The total 
spending required to get to net zero—as well as the share that would need to be public funded 
or subsidized—depends greatly on whether costs come down in areas such as electric mobility, 
utility-scale storage, and renewable generation. 

These forces have varying potential across regions
On the empowerment side, baseline growth alone can close 37 percent of the gap globally, while 
business-led innovation can provide an additional 26 percent. In other words, pushing beyond 
the baseline makes the difference between getting a little more than a third of the way to the 
combined global aspirations and getting almost two-thirds of the way there.

The effects are strikingly different by region, depending on starting points and growth 
potential. Among high-income countries, accelerated growth and business-led innovation fills 
just over half the gap in the United States in our scenario. These forces have the potential to do 
significantly more elsewhere—in fact, our scenario shows them getting Australia, Canada, and 
New Zealand more than 85 percent of the way to universal empowerment. 

Accelerating beyond baseline growth 
makes the difference between getting 
a little more than a third of the way 
to the combined goals and getting 
almost two-thirds of the way there.

89 Learning rates refer to the annual rate of decrease in unit capital expenditures for a given technology, which occurs through 

R&D expenditure, learning by doing, and broader economies of scale. More broadly, we use the NGFS Current Policies scenario 
to estimate how much spending is likely under current policy frameworks driven by growth and innovation (with warming of 
about 3.0°C by 2100). Other “current policy” scenarios may produce slightly different warming outcomes, though all would find 
a gap with a net-zero trajectory.

67

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthAmong emerging economies, China and India stand to get the greatest bumps from growth 
and business innovation. In fact, these forces have the potential to erase more than 90 percent 
of India’s empowerment gap and virtually all of China’s (Exhibit 11).90 This would lift about 
700 million people in India and over 730 million in China above the threshold by 2030. Both 
countries have made remarkable progress against extreme poverty; raising living standards 
for a much larger segment of the population is the next step up the ladder. However, both 
countries have seen productivity growth stall recently, a trend that urgently needs to be 
reversed. Our model assumes productivity growth rises by almost one percentage point in

90 The lift required for global empowerment is based on 2020 empowerment thresholds. We do not adjust annually, although the 
line may in fact rise due to increasing per capita income, changes in input costs, and changing expectations. Conversely, we 
also do not model the potential positive GDP implications of having many more empowered and productive workers.

With accelerated growth, some 
770 million people across the African 
continent could exceed 50 percent 
of the empowerment line, almost 
doubling the number from 2020. 

40 percent of its empowerment gap unmet. The most challenging picture is in sub-Saharan 
Africa, where much of the population is below the empowerment line. We estimate that growth 
momentum can close only 23 percent of the gap by 2030 but will nonetheless be a powerful 
force in eliminating extreme poverty and raising millions closer to the empowerment line. The 
importance of substantial economic and labor market transformations in these regions cannot 
be overstated. 

On the net-zero side, our scenario shows that growth and business-led innovation could 
together fill about 30 to 60 percent of the gap (Exhibit 12). China is at the lower end of 
the range when it comes to the role of business-led action, despite its clear capacity for 
innovation. This is due to significant current levels of investment (much of it going into low-
emissions power capital expenditures), which are not counted toward the gap directly. When 
considering the total low-emissions spending need to 2030, which includes current levels of 
investment, more than half of China’s need is met after counting growth and innovation. 

While growth and innovation alone will be insufficient to meet the whole need in any region, the 
opportunities becoming viable are significant and worth seizing. For instance, our estimates 
suggest that some $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in low-emissions spending could become cost-
competitive with traditional alternatives in this decade in both the EU and United Kingdom region 
and the United States. China and India could each pursue opportunities of around $0.5 trillion 
to $2 trillion over the decade. Creating the conditions to unleash this will be critical everywhere, 
but particularly in these regions, which collectively account for two-thirds of the overall net-zero 
investment gap. 

After maximizing growth and innovation, residual gaps remain— 
and pose hard choices 
Market forces and current policy frameworks can make historic progress. Yet after capturing 
the benefits of growth and what businesses can do, substantial gaps remain unfilled, 
amounting to $40 trillion across both aspirations. This is the global total, cumulative through 
the decade, with roughly $13 trillion on the empowerment side and $26 trillion in net-zero 
spending through 2030.

Each country and region has a unique share of this residual global gap, depending on its current 
development challenges, its growth prospects, and how carbon-intensive its economy currently 
is (Exhibit 13). Developing countries account for nearly two-thirds of the difference. 

How could these gaps get closer to being fully closed? Societies could reorient growth  
more intentionally toward inclusion and sustainability through new policies and injections 
of public support. This could take the form of funding from governments and state-owned 
enterprises, multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, philanthropies, and 
social investors. Importantly, these heightened commitments could be designed to activate 
more from the private sector or to address needs where the economics simply do not work for 
private actors.  

On the inclusion side, such efforts could focus on making the essentials more affordable. 
Public–private action could be shaped to achieve quality and cost improvements in essential 
goods and services—by, for example, encouraging more affordable housing, lowering the cost 
of healthcare, or making it easier to access nutritious food. We use an empirical, productivity-
driven lens to size this potential, benchmarking against economies that have managed

to deliver the most cost-effective improvements in outcomes over the past two decades. 
Businesses responding to societal expectations and opting to share a greater proportion  
of productivity with workers through more labor-friendly work arrangements could add 
another slice. 

Yet even after these actions, our scenario shows a gap of $10 trillion remaining, cumulative 
over the decade, to get to full empowerment. Increased direct transfers to vulnerable 
households or higher direct public spending on education, healthcare, or housing could 
potentially address this gap, but the broader consequences for labor markets and growth itself 
are uncertain.

R&D machinery needs to be fully 
focused on the goal of making  
low-emissions technologies cheaper. 

On the net-zero side, regulation and funding support can be geared toward closing the unfilled 
gap. Major economies setting clear mandates for the phase-out of traditional combustion-
engine vehicles has helped to shift the offerings of most major auto manufacturers, for 
example, while renewable energy mandates have changed the agenda for utilities. 

All interventions imply costs to consumers, so our scenario focuses on filling the residual net-
zero investment gap in a way that makes low-emissions technologies cost competitive for 
private actors, through some combination of public funding and changed market incentives. 
For example, national grid systems need to be expanded and upgraded to deliver electricity 
generated from renewable sources; in many places, this would involve installing new 
transmission lines to connect sunny or windy open spaces to major cities with intensive energy 
needs. In many countries, the power utilities responsible for building out this infrastructure are 
public entities—and when they lay the groundwork, private wind and solar projects can come 
online. Elsewhere, putting public funds into subsidy schemes or blended finance (such as 
grants, guarantees, or loans at favorable terms) can improve the economics of specific projects 
and technologies to such a degree that private agents (both companies and households) 
will act. Tax credits that make electric vehicles cost competitive with traditional vehicles are 
already influencing the decisions of some car buyers, for example; expanding those credits 
could sway more of them. And for net-zero projects that are far from being cost competitive 
with traditional alternatives, public commitments may be the only answer. 

All told, we estimate that some $10 trillion of societal commitments globally over the decade 
could crowd in an even larger amount of private capital and avoid some of the spending 
need altogether as scaled-up deployment further drives down the cost of low-emissions 
technologies (see chapter 5 for a more detailed explanation of the assumptions underpinning 
this scenario). 

Different outcomes are possible depending on the extent of growth, innovation, and  
public-private action 
The extent to which economies achieve growth and societies choose to prioritize empowerment 
and net-zero aspirations suggests a broad range of possible outcomes. 

If economic growth stays at the baseline but innovation does not bring down the cost of low-
emissions technologies as much as expected, and no additional commitments are made, some 
830 million people would cross the empowerment line by 2030, by our estimates. But just under 
four billion would remain below it, and the world would be on a trajectory to exceed 3.0°C of 
warming by 2100.91

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growth — Innovation-led accelerated growth. Countries could choose to focus on maximizing 
what market forces can do, making no additional societal commitments. With higher 
economic growth and innovation delivering the anticipated productivity improvements 
and reductions in the price of low-emissions technologies, 2.1 billion people could move 
above the empowerment threshold, but the world would be on a 3.0°C warming path. This 
would produce much more progress, especially on the empowerment side, than the current 
trajectory, although it would be far from closing the gaps. 

 — Commitment to partially address either gap. Assuming high growth and innovation, 

societies could choose to address one of the residual gaps, leaving the other to be addressed 
by market forces alone. The exhibit illustrates societies choosing to tackle net zero 
completely, but not empowerment. The choice is not binary, of course. Many combinations 
could yield partial progress on both challenges in tandem. 

 — Commitment to fully close both gaps. In this scenario, the global population would be 

fully empowered with a higher standard of living, and the world would be on track to achieve 
net zero by midcentury, hopefully limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100. This would take a best-
case scenario of global growth and innovation along with higher commitments that wholly—
and effectively—address the combined $40 trillion residual gap over the decade. 

The important assumption in the final two scenarios is that public commitments on such  
a scale would be well targeted and would spur additional private activity and investment.  
In the final chapter of this report, we illustrate the dimensions of what this would entail if 
societies choose to go the last mile, exploring options that include not only debt and taxes 
but also more effective allocation and management of current public spending. However, it is 
possible that such extensive commitments could distort the baseline economy or have other 
unanticipated consequences. 

Empowerment and the net-zero transition affect each 
other—and some tensions would need to be managed
As people move toward empowerment, their consumption rises, with implications for 
sustainability. And as the world moves toward net zero, risks arise for households and labor 
markets, especially if the transition is “disorderly.” These types of spillover effects need to be 
anticipated and managed to ensure smoother progress toward both goals. 

Anticipating a feedback loop: Billions of new consumers and the impact on sustainability
Empowerment as we have defined it rests on faster economic growth and results in billions 
of people around the world increasing consumption to reach minimum levels of sufficiency. 
Throughout history, prosperity has frequently come with an environmental cost. As people become 
more affluent, many increase car travel and shift to a more meat-based diet.92 Industrialization has 
increased environmental degradation, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.

As mentioned earlier, our analysis builds in the assumption that higher economic growth 
increases the net-zero financing need, relying on the historical relationship of growth to the 
production and consumption of energy- and emissions-intensive products. But going further to 
achieve full empowerment by 2030 could push these needs—and therefore emissions—even 
higher than what is accounted for in this adjustment.

National Academy of Sciences, volume 100, number 8, April 2003.

74

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthUsing data from India, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we estimate that 
moving everyone to the empowerment line could raise demand for energy-intensive products 
and services, and in turn emissions, by as much as an additional 15 percent above the effects of 
accelerated growth alone.93 However, significant uncertainties surround the effects of growth 
and empowerment on emissions.94 

Historical patterns could change, for example, if consumers shift behaviors or change what 
products they buy. Consumption is necessary to improve well-being and the standard of 
living for populations that are currently deprived, and it is crucial to driving economic growth. 
Nevertheless, the nature of consumption can evolve in a more sustainable direction. An 
important part of making this possible will be accelerating innovation to reduce the cost of 
sustainable technologies. 

Eventually, consumer choices will reflect costs and benefits. The preference for sustainable 
technologies and products is likely to rise in tandem with empowerment levels—as long as those 
options are affordable. This once again underscores the importance of continued innovation to 
increase spending on low-emissions technologies. 

How the net-zero transition could affect empowerment
As the net-zero transition gains momentum, it is likely to affect jobs and productivity, which 
in turn affects economic inclusion. This starts with the physical overhaul itself, which could 
produce a surge of jobs in construction and related manufacturing. Additional shifts are likely 
in ongoing operations and maintenance. Previous MGI research found that the transition could 
add just over 200 million direct and indirect jobs worldwide by 2050 while causing about 
185 million job losses, a small net impact.95 Other researchers similarly foresee limited net 
impacts on jobs and employment.96

But that disguises the potential for churn as jobs are redistributed across sectors. Our  
earlier modeling found the biggest potential shifts (with large numbers of jobs both added 
and lost) in agriculture, auto manufacturing, and power. This could occur alongside significant 
outright losses in oil, gas, and coal. Literature finding negative impacts on productivity 
focuses on short-term transition challenges, such as skills gaps and structural difficulties in 
reallocating labor, both specifically within the energy sector and across the global economy.97

The effects could be concentrated geographically. Regional economies that are dependent 
on fossil fuel extraction (such as coal mining) and emissions-intensive production could 

93 Data on household energy expenditures from the UK Office for National Statistics, US Consumer Expenditure Survey, Statistics 

South Africa, and India 68th Round of National Sample Survey. Energy expenditures are uplifted for each decile under the 
empowerment line, then used to estimate the relative increase in emissions per capita for each country (based on World Bank 
CO2 energy-related emissions data for each country’s direct emissions). Does not include non-energy and non-CO2 emissions, 
which could change the estimate.

94 In view of these uncertainties, we do not adjust our scenario for this enhanced level of potential energy-intensive demand from 
higher empowerment. Nor do we adjust our growth assumptions to account for potentially higher economic growth that could 
be enabled by having a more empowered and productive workforce by 2030.

in our earlier work examine a longer time frame (through 2050) than this report (which looks at investment needs through 
2030). In addition, other forces—most notably automation—will cause occupational shifts alongside the net-zero transition.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthexperience significant dislocation, and the jobs being added may not be in the same locations. 
In 44 counties within the United States, for example, more than 10 percent of employment is 
in coal, oil, and gas, fossil fuel–based power, and automotive manufacturing.98 Challenges 
in specific sectors and regions make it crucial to consider how to manage job transitions 
effectively and support the workers, sectors, and regions most affected by job losses. 

Apart from quantity, the quality of jobs resulting from the net-zero transition has also come into 
focus. Although there is no perfect definition of “green” jobs, research has found that they tend 
to be better-paying (especially at lower skill levels) and less at risk of automation than their 
“less green” counterparts.99 Additionally, green policies and related low-emissions innovation 
could boost labor productivity in low-emissions parts of the economy such as renewables 
and services, improving the potential wage outlook for workers in those sectors.100 Some 
case studies also point to green innovation and environmental standards improving labor 
productivity at the firm level.101

The net-zero transition could also affect consumption, overall economic output, and 
productivity, with implications for real wages. On the positive side, research indicates that 
innovation on clean technologies spills over to other sectors of the economy at a faster rate 
than dirty technologies.102 Changes in energy prices could also have knock-on effects on other 
parts of the economy, though the direction, size, and time frame of those changes remain 
uncertain. Higher energy prices could result, for example, if carbon prices on fossil fuels are 
imposed before low-emissions energy sources become widely available; in the near term, 
this could crowd out consumption and investment.103 But energy prices could also fall over 
time due to the lower operating costs of renewable energy sources, for example, or through 
energy efficiency measures. This could have the opposite impact, spurring greater output, 
productivity, and income. 

If interventions such as carbon taxes increase the costs of energy and other goods for 
consumers, they could create a disproportionate burden for people below the empowerment 
line.104 Solutions can minimize the potential toll on displaced workers and on overall economic 
output. For example, if carbon taxes are applied, the revenues they generate can be recycled 
into economic development of distressed communities or direct transfers to low-income 
households.105 We return to this topic in chapter 6.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthThe two aspirations also have complementary aspects. Not acting to curb temperature rise could 
harm growth—and empowerment—substantially through effects such as impairing the ability to 
work outdoors, agricultural losses, and damage to capital stock. Lower-income people would 
become even more exposed to hazards if climate change is not convincingly addressed. And 
research has shown that as households become more empowered, they are more likely to be 
aware of the risks of climate change and, in turn, lend support to net-zero policies.106 For more on 
some current initiatives that address both priorities together, see Box 3, “Two for one: Innovations 
that advance inclusion and sustainability” (in chapter 4). 

In this chapter, we offer a high-level overview of the scenario frameworks used in this research. In 
the two chapters that follow, we will zoom in to explore in greater detail a scenario for closing the 
empowerment gap and then a scenario for closing the net-zero investment gap.

4. How far can the world 
get toward universal 
economic empowerment?

Our analysis of what it would take to lift everyone above the empowerment line focuses on 
the economics involved in filling this gap. These numbers add up to much more than an abstract 
exercise. They ultimately represent the lives, aspirations, and prospects of individuals. 

As described in chapter 1, empowerment is a complement to the extreme poverty line. It is 
a higher bar that measures the next stage of progress, incorporating higher minimum living 
standards. It is calculated to meet a full range of basic needs and get people to the point at 
which they can begin to save and are no longer at risk of slipping back into poverty. When people 
have stability, they can begin to invest in themselves and in improving their own circumstances, 
exercising more choice about where and how they live and the work they do. This would activate 
much more of the world’s vast untapped human potential, broadening the possibilities for the 
next generation. 

However, universal empowerment requires a tremendous rechanneling of economic resources 
in the short term, while the full benefits may take longer to manifest. The global population 
currently below the threshold needs to have additional spending power to access a full range of 
basics—an increase we calculate at $37 trillion, cumulative over the decade. This chapter maps 
out how portions of the gap can be addressed. 

Growth is critical to furthering empowerment. But it needs to translate into gains for people in 
their roles as workers or consumers, leading to more broad-based prosperity.107

Businesses can achieve a great deal of progress by creating more productive jobs and equipping 
workers to make transitions to better occupations with rising wages. In fact, we calculate that 
growth plus business-led innovation focused on upskilling workers could produce enough 
momentum to fill almost two-thirds of the total gap (Exhibit 15). 

Going further would mean a departure. The unfilled gap could be addressed through a 
combination of more labor-friendly public and company policies plus public-private action to 
make essential services more affordable and effective. Depending on their capacity, countries

could choose to increase their commitments, fully closing their empowerment gaps through 
direct transfers or additional investment in social and public goods. 

While our research involves a global, macro scenario, inclusion is ultimately about improving 
individual lives. Exhibits 16 and 17 show how someone in an advanced economy and someone in a 
developing economy could hypothetically reach the empowerment line. 

Empowerment starts with economic growth 
Economic growth has produced historic progress in human development indicators over the past 
two decades—and its role in doing the same in the years to 2030 cannot be overestimated. 

Today, about 60 percent of the global population lives below the empowerment threshold. We 
estimate that baseline global growth averaging 2.7 percent annually could take that share down

to 46 percent, assuming growth in line with historical patterns. This effect would occur through 
job creation, higher wages, and household transfers and social support increasing in proportion 
to growth. As a result, 830 million people could gain enough purchasing power to cross the 
empowerment line, filling 37 percent of the global empowerment gap. China, in particular, could 
all but eliminate its empowerment gap by the decade’s end.  However, with no additional action, 

82

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growth3.9 billion people worldwide could remain below the empowerment line at the end of the decade, 
based on our estimates.108

Higher productivity can fill more of the gap 
Businesses pursuing initiatives in their own interest can fill an additional 26 percent of the 
empowerment gap. We see two mechanisms for this. 

Accelerated productivity growth
First, if the business sector doubles down on productivity to lift global growth to an average of 
3.4 percent annually, it could boost wages for workers, even assuming historical patterns hold.109 
Achieving faster productivity-driven growth can narrow the empowerment gap by $2 trillion, 
lifting an additional 170 million people above the empowerment threshold.

As discussed in chapter 3, many real avenues could boost productivity. The continued digitization 
of business operations and the accelerating adoption of automation technologies could finally 
deliver a productivity dividend, particularly for lagging sectors, firms, and regions.110 Innovators 
can create new businesses, new types of work, and products and services that address new 
markets. Farm and non-farm sectors have the potential to raise productivity, in aggregate, by at 
least 0.5 to 1.0 percent each year across regions, as outlined in prior MGI research.111 

Upskilling workers for better-paying jobs  
A second and related area in which businesses can take action is similarly aligned with their own 
interests: upskilling workers to prepare them for better-paying jobs as the occupational mix 
changes across countries. 

Investment and technology adoption are important elements of higher productivity. This creates 
the challenge—and the opportunity—to upskill workers to make successful job transitions 
into more productive roles. Previous MGI research has explored the scale of the skill shifts 
and occupational transitions that will likely be needed in the years ahead.112 Our analysis here 
suggests that roughly 10 percent of lower- and mid-skill workers globally could see their wages 
rise if they are equipped to take on higher-skill jobs by 2030 in response to technology, sector-
specific growth opportunities, and other trends.113

Employers themselves are an underappreciated engine of human capital development; people 
continue adding skills throughout their working lives. Previous MGI research showed that work 
experience contributes 46 percent of the average individual’s lifetime earnings, and skills learned 
on the job are an even bigger determinant of incomes for anyone without educational credentials 
who starts out in low-wage work.114

108 All calculations are relative to the empowerment gap in 2020. In reality, the threshold will rise as a country develops, so China 
and other countries could still have populations below a new and higher threshold in 2030 (although by 2020 standards, the 
gap will be closed).

109 We note that this is not a forecast; instead, it is a scenario meant to illustrate the benefits and importance of higher 

productivity growth. While this research discusses aggregate global growth rates, our underlying model incorporates varied 
growth rates across countries.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthBusiness-led training and coaching is therefore a major opportunity for people below the 
empowerment line to gain skills and move into stable jobs with opportunities to advance and 
build their incomes over time. As countries build out or adapt their physical infrastructure and 
invest in the energy transition, for example, they would add jobs in construction, utilities, and 
energy. As the economy continues to digitize, businesses will increasingly need workforces that 
can use the latest tools to stay competitive. In manufacturing, for instance, automation is likely 
to make traditional assembly line work recede in favor of more technical roles. More healthcare 
workers are needed both in high-income economies with aging populations and in developing 
countries that are expanding their coverage. In all of these areas, employers will need new kinds 
of skills that may not be readily available, particularly as technologies continue to evolve. They will 
need to deliver training and apprenticeship to fill these needs, whether they do it themselves or 
as part of broader coalitions. 

Using MGI’s global future of work model, we look at how the mix of jobs is likely to change across 
economies by 2030. If employers take the lead in training workers to move into new, more 
remunerative types of roles they need to fill, wages could rise for the workers who successfully 
make these transitions, as a by-product. While this dynamic would benefit the entire labor force, 
we isolate the impact for workers below the empowerment line only, since that population is the 
subject of our research. Globally, we estimate that upskilling could close an additional $8 trillion 
of the global empowerment gap as people move into better-paying jobs. But upskilling does not 
happen without intentional effort. It will be a heavy lift for businesses to improve this dynamic, 
especially where the process involves bringing people from subsistence farming or informal 
sectors into more productive work.

Historic progress is possible: Lifting more than two billion people to the empowerment  
line and 600 million out of poverty
All told, we estimate that higher growth combined with creating and filling more productive jobs 
could close $10 trillion of the global empowerment gap over and above what baseline growth 
alone could account for. This includes the impact of social and public transfers rising in line with 
higher growth. 

This is an opportunity to raise living standards and transform lives on a massive scale, lifting 
2.1 billion people into empowerment and 600 million more out of poverty (Exhibit 18).115 In this 
scenario, the share of the global population below the empowerment line drops from about 
60 percent to 30 percent and the share in poverty shrinks to 3 percent over the decade. By  
way of comparison, in the two decades from 2000 to 2020, the share of the global population 
below the empowerment line dropped some 20 percentage points, as 1.9 billion people rose 
above it. Getting to the full aspiration would require a significant acceleration over the historical 
rate of progress. 

Assuming that societies do not make additional commitments to raise living standards at the 
lower end of the pyramid, most countries would take longer to achieve full empowerment. But 
accelerated economic growth would still help achieve historic progress, eliminating the most 
severe forms of poverty in much of the world by 2030 (although we note the unique difficulties in 
places where conflicts are ongoing, among other deep-rooted structural issues). 

The toughest empowerment challenge is in sub-Saharan Africa. If economic growth remains at 
the baseline, the absolute numbers of those experiencing the most extreme deprivation (set at

20 percent of the empowerment line, roughly equivalent to extreme poverty) might actually tick 
up as the population rises. But accelerated productivity-driven growth could cut that population 
in half, which translates to 250 million people exiting poverty. The gap remaining to fully erase 
poverty in this scenario amounts to a spending lift of $100 billion over a decade, equivalent to 
about 5 percent of total public spending in these countries, projected at historical rates. At the 
same time, living standards would continue to improve for the rest of the population. In a high-
growth scenario, the population that achieves at least 50 percent of the empowerment standard 
would rise from 260 million in 2020 to 550 million in 2030. Transforming so many lives would 
expand the continent’s possibilities in profound ways. 

How could the rest of the empowerment gap be addressed?
Economic growth and business-led innovation could make tremendous progress toward 
empowerment. However, in most countries, portions of the gap would remain unfilled.

Part of that could involve 
creating enablers to activate more from businesses. One avenue is for employers to reshape 
work arrangements. Working individually and with industry coalitions, employee associations, 
and policy makers, businesses could potentially increase labor’s share of income in line with 
the best trends achieved by peer countries. Another avenue is for organizations to deliver more 
affordable essential products and services, with better quality and outcomes, by matching the 
productivity improvements achieved historically in some economies. Together, these avenues 
could collectively close an additional 9 percent of the global empowerment gap. The remaining 
unfilled gap could be addressed with direct transfers to vulnerable households or with increased 
investment in public goods. 

However, as discussed in chapter 3, getting to full universal empowerment implies rising 
consumption and energy demand that could affect the net-zero challenges. It will be important 
to look for solutions that address the intersection of these issues (see Box 3, “Two for one: 
Innovations that advance inclusion and sustainability”). 

Implementing more labor-friendly policies
In the previous section, we discussed how labor income can increase if accelerated productivity 
growth enables workers to take on better-paying jobs. Beyond focusing on growth and 

Box 3

Two for one: Innovations that advance inclusion and sustainability 

A resource-constrained world needs 
solutions that advance sustainability 
and inclusion together. Innovating at 
the intersection of these goals can have 
mutually reinforcing effects. We discuss 
some examples below for consideration, 
while noting that each country should 
evaluate what could be most applicable 
and effective for its own context. Local 
innovation could adapt these ideas (and 
find many more) that deliver what newly 
empowered populations and communities 
actually want and need to make their  
lives better.  

 — Clean cookstoves: The International 

Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 
more than 2.5 billion people lack 

access to clean cooking facilities. 
Many poor households resort to 
burning coal, kerosene, wood, or 
animal dung; this produces indoor 
air pollution that carries health risks 
while contributing to emissions and 
deforestation. It also means drudgery 
for millions of women and girls who 
must gather this fuel and cook in 
unsafe conditions.1 Around the world, a 
number of companies, entrepreneurs, 
and nonprofits such as the Clean 
Cooking Alliance have developed 
clean cookstoves that can be 
manufactured, installed, and operated 
at low cost. Climate Impact Partners 
and CQuestCapital are two companies 
that offer other companies the 

opportunity to underwrite cookstove 
deployment for carbon credits. 

 — Sustainable affordable housing: 

Countries around the world have 
a shortage of decent affordable 
housing. As they expand the supply, 
developers, builders, and governments 
can incorporate sustainable design 
principles and materials as well as 
installing features such as rainwater 
harvesting equipment, solar panels, and 
green roofs. Mexico’s EcoCasa program, 
for example, is a joint venture between 
the country’s federal mortgage provider, 
the Inter-American Development Bank, 
and Germany’s development bank 
(KfW), capitalized with international

climate funds. It has financed dozens of 
developers to build more than 65,000 
affordable energy-efficient homes, 
providing both concessional loans 
and technical assistance.2 Habitat for 
Humanity, one of the largest nonprofit 
builders of affordable homes in the 
United States and around the globe, 
ensures that its homes are sustainable, 
durable, and energy efficient. The 
organization aims to provide 
homeowners with healthy environments 
and lower their life-cycle costs.3

 — Mass transit: Expanding access to 

public transportation can keep cars off 
the road and lower commuting costs, 
which can be a boon for those who 
are not yet economically empowered. 
In Bogotá, a city with heavy traffic 
congestion and an overwhelmed 
mass transit system, a new public bus 
company called La Rolita expanded 
transit into underserved neighborhoods. 
It operates a fleet of almost 200 new 
electric buses that are easy to maintain 
and thus more reliable. The company 
also made it a point to hire women for 
traditionally male-dominated driving 
roles, advancing gender equity and 
creating jobs that have brought people 
out of the informal economy.4 More 
local authorities are experimenting 
with making public transit free. These 

include Tallin, Estonia; Dunkirk, France; 
and Kansas City, Missouri. Luxembourg 
eliminated all transit fares nationwide, 
and Washington, DC, is now making all 
public bus rides free. 

 — Distributed energy: According to 

IEA data, almost 775 million people 
lacked electricity in 2022, most of 
them in sub-Saharan Africa.5 In late 
2022, the World Bank announced a 
partnership with governments, private 
investors, and development agencies 
to fast-track off-grid solar technology 
and mini-grids in Africa, with an eye 
toward eventually expanding them 
globally. Among the project priorities 
will be systems for schools and 
medical facilities as well as cold chain 
storage for farmers.6 Expanding the 
off-grid energy sector can also be a 
source of jobs.

 — Low-cost two- and three-wheel EVs: 
While electric cars have made real 
inroads in high-income economies, 
they have lower penetration in many 
low- and middle-income countries. 
Two- and three-wheelers can provide 
viable transportation options to 
households that cannot yet afford 
cars—and some consumers prefer 
their mobility and ease of parking 
in highly congested cities. Shifting 

from diesel-powered motorbikes 
and making affordable electric 
versions available can also reduce air 
pollution and create an opportunity for 
developing countries to establish new 
manufacturing value chains.7

 — Supporting smallholder farmers: 
The half billion smallholder farmers 
worldwide are critical to global 
food security and stewards of 
natural resources. But many are 
impoverished rural residents who are 
heavily exposed to climate change 
and environmental degradation. 
Supporting these farmers to boost 
food production in harsher conditions 
is in everyone’s interests. The 
International Fund for Agricultural 
Development, a UN agency, focuses 
on improving land management and 
farming practices in developing 
countries.8 Recent McKinsey research 
identified more than 30 measures 
that could help smallholder farmers 
adapt to and mitigate climate change; 
these include pest management, 
drought-tolerant seed varieties, soil 
testing and amendment, animal health 
monitoring, rotational grazing, and 
more. Governments, investors, and 
development finance institutions all 
have a role to play in scaling up more 
sustainable practices.9

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthupskilling, additional steps can address labor’s declining share of national incomes—that is, the 
share of economic output returned to workers as compensation. This share has been trending 
downward in recent decades across multiple countries, both high-income and developing 
(Exhibit 19).116 This decline has broad implications for workers’ earnings and prospects. It reflects 
wages growing more slowly than productivity and a hollowing out of the middle class, while a 
greater share of income now goes to companies and investors (in the form of profits, interest,  
and dividends).

Labor-friendly work arrangements could help alleviate this trend, after accounting for the 
improvement possible through employment shifts. 

Employers themselves can take action to implement more worker-friendly arrangements. This 
could involve choices to pay living wages, improve working conditions, expand leave policies 
and dependent care support, or improve workers’ retirement security. Market forces and 
demographics may mean that companies improve their value propositions for employees in part 
to stay competitive. Across multiple economies, many workers not only changed jobs during the 
COVID-19 pandemic but came away with higher expectations for what they will accept. In the 
longer term, many major economies have aging populations, and structural labor shortages will 
continue to favor workers. Larger companies have the ability to foster more labor-friendly work 
arrangements throughout their supply chains. They also have the option of creating employee 
ownership plans, which help workers build wealth and create incentives for the workforce to 
ensure the organization’s performance.

Employer actions could be spurred through policy measures such as raising the minimum 
wage and strengthening labor regulations for overtime, employee classification, and benefits. 
Strengthening the ability to organize and bargain collectively is another potential pillar; the 
shrinking role of unions has been suggested to be a driver of the declining labor share of income 
in the United States, in particular.117 Competition policy is another area to examine; industry 
consolidation and superstar effects have also contributed to the decline.118 However, the 
implications for the baseline economy and growth would need to be assessed.

How much could improving the labor share of income contribute to closing the empowerment 
gap? We arrive at an estimate by sorting countries into cohorts and quantifying the potential 
if countries matched their best-performing peers in historical labor share trend; this gives us 
a benchmark that is reasonably attainable, based on empirical evidence. After calculating this 
potential, we separate out the share of those gains related to moving into better-paying jobs 
and upskilling (as described earlier); we then attribute the rest to changes in company or public 
policies.119 Not all of the resulting gains in income would go to workers below the empowerment 
line. But those that do could help to shrink the empowerment gap by an average of just over 
1 percent, or $500 billion, by our estimates. 

116  See, for example, The labour share in G20 economies, International Labour Organization and OECD, February 2015; and Gene 
M. Grossman and Ezra Oberfield, The elusive explanation for the declining labor share, NBER working paper number 29165, 
August 2021.

the American economy, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring 2020.

118  A new look at the declining labor share of income in the United States, McKinsey Global Institute, May 2019.
119  To separate out the share of those gains that are related to the occupational mix changing over time (with a heavier 

representation of higher-skill jobs), we use MGI’s future of work models. We assume that companies will fill those roles and 
provide the necessary upskilling, as described earlier in this chapter. These gains tend to be much larger for developing 
countries. Capturing the remaining potential would require shifts in policy and business practices as described here; this would 
have more effect in high-income economies. The labor force can also grow in sectors that historically have paid a greater share 
of income to labor, such as construction and retail, with expanded affordable housing.

the labor share from 2020 to 2030. For other countries, we allowed for additional upskilling growth based on MGI’s future of work projections.

Just as taking a holistic approach to sustainability, inclusion, and growth can create a virtuous 
cycle, the same principle applies to the essential goods and services needed by households. 
Around the world, a nutritious diet, secure housing with access to clean drinking water, 
sanitation, and energy, along with healthcare and education, work in concert to support an 
individual’s well-being, social inclusion, and productivity. 

One of the biggest factors influencing empowerment is the cost and quality of these essential 
goods and services. Previous MGI research documented that rising real prices for essentials 
such as housing, education, and healthcare eroded half of the median household’s real income 
gains in many high-income economies.120 In developing countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and 
Peru, food and energy account for more than 40 percent of household consumption.121 When 
the basics require such a high share of wallet, there is little room left for discretionary spending 
or savings, and price spikes are keenly felt. When the price of food increases, even people who 
are not in extreme poverty can face hunger. Today millions of people across the Middle East and 
North Africa are struggling to afford staples.122

We take a purely productivity-based approach, looking at potential cost reductions and outcome 
improvements that could benefit the population below the empowerment line. Globally, we find 
that the amount of daily spending required to be empowered could be reduced by an average 
of 9 percent by 2030 if countries matched their best-performing peers in productivity within 
construction, healthcare, and education, and in keeping food price levels in line with overall 
inflation.123 This opportunity varies between advanced economies and emerging markets, 
depending on the spending category. Housing and healthcare make up a greater share of 
the savings opportunity in advanced economies, while developing economies could also see 
significant gains in empowerment from education and food affordability. We assume that the 
higher productivity gains are passed on to people living below the empowerment threshold in 
proportion to their use of such essentials. Making that happen in practice could imply changes to 
policy or incentives, perhaps providing resources to support demand in affordable segments or 
making greater supply viable. 

For more on these topics, see the “Spotlight” feature at the end of this report.

Healthcare
The COVID-19 pandemic drove home just how much health matters for individuals, society,  
and the global economy. Health and growth are inextricably linked. One study estimates that 
about a third of economic growth in the past century can be attributed to improvements in 
global health.124

Many low- and middle-income countries are building out healthcare systems, investing 
more to expand access and train more healthcare professionals. This already implies greater 
expenditure. But there is also a major opportunity for countries at every income level to focus

per capita spending. Some countries, such as Greece and South Africa, have improved health 
outcomes while maintaining or reducing the level of per capita healthcare spending, while others, 
like Slovakia and Switzerland, have improved their outcomes while expanding spending. 

We consider a scenario in which each country matches the recent productivity gains of its best-
performing peer over the next decade. We find a 36 percent opportunity to improve health 
outcomes globally, even keeping current levels of private and public healthcare spending across 
countries constant.125

Housing
Adequate and affordable housing is a foundational need that has spillover benefits on health, 
education, physical security, and economic stability. Yet rents and home prices have risen far 
faster than incomes in many countries, particularly in large cities where job opportunities are 
concentrated. 

One significant cause of high housing costs is low productivity in constructing homes. 
Productivity within the construction sector overall is consistently poor around the world, 
averaging only 1 percent a year globally over the past two decades, compared with 2.8 percent 
for the total world economy and 3.6 percent in the case of manufacturing.126

We estimate that improvements to construction productivity could lower housing expenditure 
by 11 percent globally if all countries emulated their best-performing peers.127 This involves 
further digitizing the design and construction management processes as well as streamlining 
regulatory compliance and innovations such as modular construction. The Netherlands 
and Singapore stand out as top historical performers; China, too, has raised construction 
productivity (Exhibit 21). Local governments can make regulatory changes to address drags  
on productivity and stimulate supply.128

125 For high-income economies, the opportunity is on average 26 percent, while for middle- and lower-income economies, the 
average is 39 percent. Despite this, high-income economies tend to spend a larger share of their consumption on healthcare, 
so the overall opportunity is greater in these countries.

126 Reinventing construction: A route to higher productivity, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2017.
127 For high-income economies, the opportunity on average is 13 percent, while for middle- and lower-income economies, the 
average is 11 percent. High-income economies also tend to spend a larger share of their consumption on housing, so housing 
affordability has a larger opportunity for improvement.

Education
Given their stage of development, many lower- and middle-income economies are investing 
to expand their education systems. But many families in these countries also have to spend 
out of pocket to improve their children’s learning outcomes. Countries at every level of income 
and education spending can deliver more—and all will need to evolve to prepare students to 
participate in a more global and digital economy.

129 This spending category has the largest variation across high-income economies versus middle- and lower-income economies. 
The improvement opportunity for the former is only 16 percent, while for the latter it is 49 percent. Food affordability also has a

Choices on social support for the rest
After considering the channels described earlier, a $10 trillion global gap remains unfilled. 
Beyond opportunities for business-led growth, labor market opportunities, and productivity-
based improvements in cost of living, societies can choose to directly raise the spending power 
of their poorest segments—and, by extension, their living standards. 

In tandem with striving for productivity improvements in essential goods and services (described 
above), public actors could consider increased direct funding for affordable housing, health, and 
quality education. In Vienna, for example, local government has invested in affordable public 
housing, which has prevented rents from skyrocketing as they have in many other large cities.131 
Initiatives can come from governments, philanthropies, social investors, development finance 
institutions, and multilateral agencies.

Another option is crafting effective social programs to reach people who need them.132 Ambition 
levels in terms of targeting might vary across countries, but it would be especially important to 
support those who do not benefit from labor market opportunities, including the very poorest, 
those living in remote communities, children, the elderly, and people unable to work. Efficient, 
transparent implementation is critical to maximizing every dollar deployed, and in many places, 
there is room for improvement. Digital tools can spot leakages while streamlining eligibility 
processes and delivering benefits more efficiently.133

Fully closing the empowerment gap by 2030 would be a tremendous stretch for the lowest-
income countries, although those that improve productivity to boost economic growth still 
have the potential to make remarkable progress against poverty. International aid, including 
assistance from multilateral institutions and debt relief programs, could be part of the solution  
as well. 

Countries that decide to fully close the empowerment gap will face political debates about which 
mechanisms to use. However, that presumes that governments have the fiscal resources at 
hand—and not all of them do. We return to this topic, and to broader issues of public funding, in 
chapter 6.

5. How could the world get 
onto a net-zero pathway?  

Decarbonizing the global economy to reach net-zero emissions involves broad deployment 
of low-emissions technologies. As described in chapter 2, the world would need a total of 
$55 trillion in low-emissions spending in this decade based on the decarbonization scenario we 
analyzed—a figure that reflects the continuation of current investment levels plus addressing a 
massive net-zero investment gap of almost $41 trillion. We arrive at this estimate through detailed 
sector and regional views that break the required spending down into clear components.134

Beyond analyzing how much spending it would take through 2030 and where that money 
would need to flow, our analysis maps out how portions of the gap can be addressed. We start 
by considering how much economic growth and innovation could yield under current policy 
frameworks. Then we consider a scenario that shows how the residual gap might be filled, if 
societies choose to make the commitment (see Box 4, “A note on methodology”).

Our model starts by assuming that the level and pattern of low-emissions spending in 2020 
continue over the decade. That year’s total was about $1.4 trillion, of which about 10 percent was 
fully private.135 Extended over the decade, an additional $14 trillion would come on stream by 
2030, with most of it publicly funded or subsidized.136

After that, growth and innovation play a critical role, as with empowerment. We examine this using 
assumptions that build on the NGFS Current Policies scenario.137 This is a world operating without 

134 We acknowledge the many uncertainties surrounding the total investment need, which could vary based on factors such as 

the specific transition pathway and evolution of technology costs. See chapter 2 for further details, including the scope of what 
is included in our investment gap.

135 We have triangulated our results from 2020 with external estimates and find them broadly in line. Any discrepancies are likely 

due to differences in how subsidies are accounted for.

136 We focus on the period between 2020 and 2030 because it is a decisive decade for altering the world’s path on emissions. As 
of 2020, the IEA estimated about 33.9 Gt of annual CO2 emissions from the energy system and 5–6 Gt of annual CO2 emissions 
from land-use systems. In the IPCC 2021 annual report, the authors found that the residual global carbon budget to remain 
within 1.5°C warming with 67 percent probability was 400 Gt. Therefore, from this report’s effective measurement start date of 
2020, the climate budget to limit warming to 1.5°C (assuming constant emissions) would run out in roughly 10 years, or around 
the end of 2030. We use a 2020 starting point to give a clear decade-long line of sight and because the NGFS scenarios, which 
provide the basis for our analysis, include historical data for energy use only up to 2020. Based on clean energy investment in 
2021 and 2022, the scale of investment still needed by 2030 has not shifted dramatically since 2020.

137 The NGFS provides climate scenarios based upon detailed and well-established integrated assessment models of the 

interaction between human activities and environmental processes. The Current Policies scenario “assumes that only currently 
implemented policies are preserved.” It provides a good proxy to estimate spend that would take place without a fundamental 
step-up in policies relative to 2020 levels. We build on this scenario and adjust it for different levels of economic growth, as 
discussed in chapter 2.

97

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthsignificant carbon taxes or major public funding commitments beyond those already in place as 
of 2020. Economic growth enables more public and private funding, and our scenario assumes 
that spending would increase in line with that growth. More importantly, innovation can unleash 
technology advances and drive down costs, clearing the way for businesses to drive and pursue 
opportunities that are currently or soon to be “in the money” (that is, cost competitive relative to 
traditional alternatives). Public finance can also “crowd in” or underwrite further private spending 
to some extent, even under current policy frameworks. The many subsidies and tax breaks for 
renewable energy investment and consumer purchases of electric vehicles illustrate this in action.

In this world, slightly less than 40 percent (some $15 trillion) of the gap is filled, but huge initial 
progress is possible. A total of $10 trillion (including $9 trillion above and beyond a continuation 
of today’s levels) would become viable for private investors and consumers by 2030 (Exhibit 23).

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthAfter accounting for market forces, technological advances, and the continuation of current 
policies, the remaining unfilled gap is $26 trillion, cumulative through the decade. This is 
equivalent to 3 percent of global GDP annually.

The remaining 60 percent of the $41 trillion net-zero investment gap could be addressed 
through combined public and private efforts. We present a scenario illustrating how this could 
play out if countries elect to go down that path.138 In such a scenario, public action could take 
the form of additional policy mechanisms as well as greater public funding. The latter would 
include increased grant and concessional funding as well as direct investment from state-owned 
entities.139 This increased societal commitment would also further unleash the world’s innovation 
machinery to continue developing new low-emissions technologies with a relentless focus on 
bringing down their costs. As a result of greater public support and innovation, more private 
spending would be crowded in. However, we caution that the scale of public support explored 
in this scenario involves the unproven assumption that such large investments and shifts do not 
damage the base economy.

Even if societies do not address the remaining unfilled gap in full, pursuing everything that 
market forces can do would be a tremendous acceleration of progress toward net zero in itself. 
At this scale, and with this additional momentum, the environment becomes more fertile for 
breakthroughs and societal shifts that we cannot foresee today. This argues for a continued 
focus on growth and innovation.

Growth and technology advances can address $15 trillion of 
the net-zero investment gap, even under current policies
To recap the start of our net-zero journey, the total low-emissions investment required for the 
2021–30 pathway we model is $55 trillion. We assume that 2020 levels of investment in low-
emissions assets and technologies ($1.4 trillion) could continue throughout the decade at the 
same scale and with the same public–private split as in the past. (Only about 10 percent of the 
2020 investment was fully private; the vast majority was either public or publicly subsidized. 
Slightly more than half of the total amount came from public sources.) Continuing 2020  
spending levels through this period provides $14 trillion cumulatively through 2030. This leaves  
a $41 trillion investment gap to fill.

Current levels of spending rise modestly with baseline growth
The first piece of the gap can be filled by economic growth. If investment from the private and 
public sectors continues at the same share of GDP as in 2020, rising only in line with baseline 
economic growth of 2.7 percent globally, an additional $3 trillion worth of opportunities could 
come on stream this decade. Overall, the current level of investment in low-emissions assets is 
too low to get to net zero based on the impact of modest GDP growth alone. 

Most of this $3 trillion in spending would involve the continuation of current developments. BEVs 
already represent more than 10 percent of new car sales as of 2022; if their market expanded 
at the same rate as baseline GDP growth, they could account for about $700 billion in low-

138 This is based on the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. This scenario assumes that governments enact strong climate policies, 
technological innovation proceeds at a rapid pace, and carbon removal is widely practiced. It reaches net-zero CO₂ emissions 
by 2050 for the economy as a whole; this means there are some residual gross emissions in hard-to-abate sectors and 
regions, but they are offset by CO₂ removals. This ultimately limits warming to only 1.5°C by 2100. This is in line with the net-zero 
aspiration we frame in this paper.

139 Public funding can come from multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, philanthropies, and social investors as 

well as from governments.

A note on methodology

To explore how the net-zero gap could be 
filled, we first estimate the full investment 
gap using the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, 
as described in chapter 2.1 We then estimate 
the scale of low-emissions spending likely 
under current policy frameworks. To do 
this, we rely on the NGFS Current Policies 
scenario, which enables us to estimate 
how much spending is likely to be unlocked 
via growth and innovation under current 
frameworks (resulting in warming of about 
3.0°C by 2100). Other scenarios estimating 
the impact of “current policies” may produce 
slightly different warming outcomes, though 
all would find a substantial gap with a net-
zero trajectory. In both cases, we build on 
these NGFS scenarios but adjust them for 
different expectations of economic growth, 
as discussed in chapter 2. We perform this 
analysis for about 50 key low-emissions 
technologies, considering variations over 
the decade across seven sectors and 12 
regions; their deployment could collectively 
address 85 percent of global greenhouse-
gas emissions.

In each case, we employed the McKinsey 
Transition Finance Model (TFM) to allocate 
the investment needs associated with each 
technology and each region to economic 
agents with the ability to address them 
(consumers, private companies, and 
public actors).2 This analysis helped us 
identify the role that private actors can 
play toward achieving net-zero goals, and 
the opportunities that a net-zero transition 
would create for them. The spending 
allocation is based on four factors: 
historical investment patterns, technology 
risk profiles, market risk profiles, and 
estimated total cost of ownership.

Historical data is incorporated to assess 
the role that could be played by specific 

agents in key sectors, such as state-
owned enterprises in the power sector. 
TFM incorporates the other three factors 
to calibrate the role of different economic 
actors. In particular, the role of public 
spending is larger for technologies further 
away from commercial maturity (those 
with higher technology risk) and in regions 
with lower ease of doing business (those 
with higher market risk). In these cases, 
public spending in the form of grant 
and concessional funding goes toward 
lowering risks for private actors, enabling 
them to participate. 

Public actors also provide further grants 
and concessional financing to support 
low-emissions technologies that are not 
cost competitive relative to traditional 
alternatives. To quantify this, we compare 
the total cost of ownership of low-emissions 
alternatives against that of traditional high-
emissions assets—for instance, a battery 
electric car against an internal-combustion-
engine car, or an electric arc scrap steel 
furnace against a blast steel furnace. Total 
cost of ownership is determined by the 
capital expenditures associated with 
purchasing the asset as well as operating 
expenses. Public spending would bridge 
the gap in total cost of ownership between 
low- and high-emissions assets, therefore 
crowding in private spending. 

In our analysis, a low-emissions technology 
is considered “in the money” for private 
actors if it is cost competitive with its 
high-emissions alternative (that is, its total 
cost of ownership is lower) under current 
policy frameworks. Importantly, even if a 
technology is in the money, some amount 
of public spending may still be needed to 
reduce technology and market risks. 

Any further private spending that may 
occur above and beyond what would occur 
under current policy frameworks is not 
considered in the money, as it would not 
take place without societal commitments 
that go beyond today’s levels.

Rather than relying on grant and 
concessional funding to bridge cost 
competitiveness gaps, another approach 
would be imposing a carbon tax to 
encourage switching away from high-
emissions assets. This research assumes 
that subsidies produce the same outcome 
as discouraging high-emissions spending 
(which raise the total cost of ownership 
through a tax). In practice, however, a 
mix of policy mechanisms would likely be 
needed to limit high-emissions spending.3

The resulting analysis should be read as 
scenarios rather than forecasts. The TFM 
assumes that individuals and companies 
are economically rational, make spending 
decisions based on the total cost of 
ownership and risk level of the assets they 
plan to acquire, and are forward-looking 
and possessed of perfect foresight. In 
reality, these assumptions may not hold, 
which would increase the public support 
needed to close the gap beyond what 
is modeled here. The scale of private 
financing needed would also vary based 
on how technology capital costs and total 
costs of ownership evolve. A multitude of 
other factors, such as evolving consumer 
preferences for green technologies, 
could also influence the scale of public 
commitments needed.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthemissions spending over the decade.140 In 2020, some $300 billion was invested in solar and 
wind generation; the continuation of this level rising in line with baseline growth would imply 
almost $4 trillion of spending over the decade.141 In the buildings sector, 180 million heat pumps 
had already been installed globally as of 2020, satisfying 7 percent of heating demand.142

A number of varied programs are already putting public money to work in current policies. 
Norway, for instance, removed its import tax on electric vehicles in 1990. Since 2000, the 
government has continued to enhance a package of incentives to buy or lease EVs, including 
waiving value-added tax, exempting EV drivers from tolls and parking fees, and offering free 
access to bus lanes and ferries.143 In addition, housing associations received subsidies for 
installing charging stations. As a result, some two-thirds of new vehicles sold in Norway are now 
electric.144 In the buildings sector, Lithuania, a country with aging housing stock, implemented 
a program that disbursed €250 million in grants for retrofits; it attracted more than double that 
amount in private financing by using part of the grants to bring down the cost of loans from 
private lenders. The European Investment Bank is now planning to expand Lithuania’s approach 
across the EU.145

Business-led innovation fuels faster growth, progress, and more private activity
Faster GDP growth, and, even more importantly, innovation to develop new technologies and 
lower their costs could deliver greater progress than baseline growth alone. All told, we find 
that accelerated growth and innovation could provide an additional $12 trillion. Adding onto 
the effects of baseline growth described immediately above, this brings the total portion of the 
net-zero investment gap that could be filled from growth and innovation under current policy 
frameworks to $15 trillion. 

To understand how this could come about, we consider a world that achieves the productivity 
gains needed to accelerate global economic growth beyond the baseline, to 3.4 percent 
annually.146  Faster growth is critical for empowerment. But it means higher production, which 
ultimately requires greater inputs of energy and physical capital. Therefore, it increases the size 
of the net-zero investment need by about almost $5 trillion worldwide, as discussed in chapter 
2. But this accelerated growth also generates more financing capacity from both the public and 
private sectors (for more on this, see chapter 6). 

This is also a scenario with technology advancement. Business innovation plays an important role 
in accelerating learning rates and deployment to reduce technology costs.147 As a result, the risks 
and costs associated with new low-emissions technologies would decrease over the decade, 
making them more cost competitive relative to traditional alternatives even under current policy 
frameworks. This creates more viable opportunities for private actors to shift their spending 
choices. As a result of innovation and improved learning rates, about $9 trillion of additional 
opportunities (above today’s levels) would become attractive for private actors over the decade. 
Adding these to the opportunities associated with extending current levels of investment, our

low-emissions spending that is  
or soon will be cost competitive for 
private actors

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthscenario sees a total of $10 trillion in low-emissions spending becoming cost competitive for 
businesses and consumers without subsidies. (See Box 5, “Accounting for the evolving costs of 
low-emissions technologies,” for more on our assumptions—and how the scenario might change 
if technological progress is slower.) 

Improved learning rates also have a second impact. As low-emissions technologies mature and 
their capital cost and total cost of ownership decrease, they require smaller subsidies to make 
them cost competitive with traditional alternatives. Every dollar of public finance can therefore 
induce greater private spending. This would reduce the relative role of grant and concessional 
funding from the public sector. All told, we find that an additional $3 trillion of private capital 
could get crowded in.

Overall, despite this change in proportion, our scenario shows public support continuing to grow 
by about $3 trillion over the decade. Beyond the public funding that could come on line with 
GDP growth, spending from development finance institutions and state-owned enterprises also 
increases in our scenario. This is again due to the impact of innovation, which helps unlock more 
investments from these entities, which could be at market rates. Much of this would occur in 
developing economies. In these countries, state-owned enterprises play a large role in the power 
sector, which would grow even under current policies to meet rising demand as these regions 
continue their economic development. 

Adding up the combined impact of continued 2020 spending ($14 trillion), economic growth and 
innovation (an additional $15 trillion), $29 trillion could theoretically be mobilized over 2021–30 in 
this scenario. Public funding would account for 36 percent of it—a significant relative reduction 
from 2020 levels, when it accounted for more than half of total low-emissions spending. As 
technology advances continue, private in-the-money spending would account for 34 percent as 
private actors can seize the initiative on cost-competitive projects and purchases. 

What comes ‘in the money’?
The opportunities coming into focus in this decade, even without major policy changes, are 
mostly in areas that are highly dynamic today. 

The power and mobility sectors in China, Europe, India, and the United States collectively make 
up about 70 percent of this category. Across these regions, we find that 10 to 60 percent of the 
investment needed in this decade in the power sector and 50 to 70 percent in mobility will be 
viable with expected rates of technological advancement.148

Electric car sales reached record highs in 2021, with registrations tripling in China compared with 
2020.149 While BEV cars are not cost competitive with traditional vehicles today based on their 
total cost of ownership, they could reach cost parity in the latter half of the decade in many parts 
of the world, thanks to factors such as the falling costs of battery packs, improvements in power 
electronics, innovation in longer-range charging, and economies of scale.150 This drives around 
$3 trillion of in-the-money spending from consumers and companies in BEV cars in the four 
aforementioned regions in our scenario. 

148 Note that while the majority of the private investment we discuss goes to mobility and power, it fills only a portion of the total 
low-emissions step-up needed in these sectors: just under two-thirds ($14.9 trillion) of the need in mobility (with an additional 
$5.5 trillion needed) and a little more than 10 percent of the $14.1 trillion needed in power (where an additional $12.4 trillion is 
required). In each case, the needs are so massive that addressing them takes every avenue.

Accounting for the evolving costs of low-emissions technologies 

Estimates of the spending required in 
the current decade to reach net zero by 
2050, as well as the level of public support 
needed, depend on projections for how the 
cost of low-emissions technologies could 
evolve. Two key sources of uncertainty 
surround these projections. First is the price 
of the inputs required for key technologies; 
second is the decrease in unit capital cost 
that can be achieved (for example, via R&D, 
economies of scale, and learning by doing). 

When it comes to input prices, sufficient 
(and sustainably sourced) mineral supplies 
are vital.1 Metals such as copper, cobalt, 
nickel, and lithium play a critical role in 
renewable generation, electricity networks, 
and battery storage technologies.2 
Demand-side pressures could lead to 
significant increases in prices of these 
minerals. One study estimates that, on a 
net-zero trajectory, the price of copper 
could increase by about 60 percent 
and the price of lithium could more than 
double between 2020 and 2030.3 In 
addition, costs may also be significantly 
affected by supply-chain issues. In 2021, 
for example, freight fees increased almost 
sixfold, which had a significant impact on 
the cost of new renewable generation 
projects.4 While supply-chain issues are 
economy-wide challenges, they may 
disproportionately affect the total cost of 
ownership of low-emissions technologies 
such as photovoltaic and wind generation. 
This would negatively affect their cost 

competitiveness when compared with 
high-emissions alternatives.5

When it comes to learning rates and 
supply-side efficiencies, considerable 
uncertainty surrounds the magnitude 
of capital cost reductions that key low-
emissions technologies can achieve during 
the current decade.6 If policies facilitating 
faster innovation are not enacted and 
innovation is slower than in the scenario 
modeled here, it would take more total 
spending to achieve net zero. Furthermore, 
the share of technologies that are in the 
money would decrease, meaning that it 
would take a higher level of public support 
to meet goals for reducing emissions. 

To assess the possible impact of these 
factors, we modeled a “high-cost” scenario 
incorporating slower learning rates as 
well as higher projected input costs for 
key materials and higher freight costs. 
The exhibit below illustrates how the total 
spending need and its allocation would 
change as a result. First, if learning rates 
were relatively slow (about 2 percent, 
compared with 3.4 percent as in the main 
scenario described in this chapter), an 
additional $4 trillion of spending would be 
needed from private and public sources, 
driven largely by higher costs for renewable 
generation and low-emissions heating. 
Second, if the prices of key inputs increase 
on top of these slower learning rates, the 
total spending over 2021–30 would rise 

by an additional $3 trillion. The main driver 
would be the higher cost of batteries. This 
would affect electric mobility and utility-
scale storage, which account for about two-
thirds of the increased spending. 

Combining the potential impact of 
higher input prices and slower learning 
rates, the share of private in-the-money 
investment opportunities would decrease 
significantly, from 18 percent to only 
8 percent of the total spending needed. 
Total public spending over the decade 
would need to increase from $20 trillion 
to $25 trillion if societies choose to 
pursue a full net-zero pathway. 

This sensitivity shows that affordability is 
critical. The total spending required to get 
to net zero—as well as the share that would 
need to be publicly funded or subsidized—
depends greatly on whether costs come 
down in areas such as electric mobility, 
utility-scale storage, and renewable 
generation. This depends in turn on 
minimizing the risks of supply-chain 
disruptions and bottlenecks in mineral 
supply. A smooth transition requires 
increased dialogue and coordination 
between companies operating at different 
parts of the value chain, between the 
public and private sectors, and between 
governments.7 It is equally important for 
the world’s R&D machinery to prioritize 
the task of making low-emissions 
technologies cheaper.

The role of intermittent renewables remains somewhat limited globally in the current policy 
framework scenario, which shows the share of solar and wind in generation (measured as a 
share of overall megawatt-hours of electricity generation) growing from about 8 percent in 2020 
to about 20 percent by 2030. One reason for the relatively low penetration of renewables is 
the need for transmission and distribution infrastructure to accommodate them. Building that 
infrastructure entails greater capital spending. Yet more projects do become feasible in the 
scenario modeled here, which has growth, technology advances, and continued cost reductions 

104

420222521232910105555559From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthcreating around $850 billion of viable investment opportunities in solar and wind generation.151 
Additional in-the-money opportunities in the power sector, including commercially viable 
investment in transmission and distribution networks and in hydropower generation, together 
account for about $1.7 trillion of the increase in private spending.

Addressing the remaining $26 trillion gap could involve increasing 
societal commitments to activate more from the private sector 
The combined actions described above would represent major progress. But getting the rest of 
the way would mean addressing additional needs of just over $26 trillion globally. This would take 
a combined public–private effort, banking on the assumption that higher societal commitments 
can activate even more private capital and scale up deployment even further. We present a 
scenario, cautioning again that the effects of such large investments and shifts on the base 
economy are unknown.

How this scenario plays out
First, clear road maps and other policy mechanisms can move markets. Policy certainty can 
offset some of the risks that could otherwise limit inflows of private capital. Various examples 
already exist. The shift to EVs, for example, is being driven not only by incentives but also by  
other types of policies. Governments from Canada, Ireland, and California to Singapore and 
South Korea have set target dates for phasing out sales of traditional internal-combustion-
engine vehicles.152

Second, we consider higher societal commitments. These could be delivered through grants 
and concessional finance (that is, lending below market rates) from governments or other 
quasi-public actors; they could also be direct investments made by state-owned enterprises or 
development finance institutions. By our estimates, public actors would need to inject almost 
$10 trillion in funding, on top of levels of support described earlier, if they aim to close the gap 
fully. This includes funding for some projects that are necessary but remain “out of the money” 
for any private agent as well as projects undertaken by state-owned enterprises. 

Governments around the world are considering measures of this kind. The US Inflation 
Reduction Act, for example, is providing multiple types of subsidies to the tune of 
$400 billion.153 Some of these incentives are attracting interest from foreign direct investors  
in fields such as green hydrogen.154

Our scenario shows that this $10 trillion infusion of public funding could unlock $17 trillion in 
additional progress. This has two components. The largest part—some $13 trillion—is another 
tranche of private investment and spending that is crowded in. An additional $4 trillion is 
spending that could be avoided altogether because of faster technological progress that 
reduces the costs of low-emissions assets. 

151  “In the money” opportunities in renewable generation do not require direct subsidies to ensure cost competitiveness vis-

à-vis conventional alternatives, but they may still receive public support via network connection guarantees or government-
supported site investigations. This is in line with the how the term “zero subsidy” has been used to describe recent wind 
auctions in Northern Europe. See, for instance, “German offshore wind to enter new era as 7 GW auction closes,” S&P Global, 
June 1, 2023.

152 See the IEA’s Global EV Policy Explorer.
153 For more on the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, see “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,” IEA, April 26, 2023. IRA spending 
includes measures similar to the grant and concessional funding described in this research as well as other forms of funding 
(for example, loan programs). The funding in the IRA is therefore not directly equivalent to the scale of public support described 
here.

105

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthIn our scenario, a $10 trillion infusion 
of public support could unlock an 
additional $17 trillion of progress.

Exhibit 24 illustrates how this might work. The darkest segments show the share of currently or 
soon-to-be viable investment opportunities for private actors (as outlined earlier in this chapter). 
The bright blue segments represent the private spending that could be induced if more public 
finance is deployed strategically to change risk and cost profiles. With a higher scale of societal 
commitment, many more sectors and geographies could attract private capital, with more 
projects involving blended finance or incentives.  

What this could mean across sectors
One of the prime examples of projects needing this type of push is electricity transmission 
and distribution. National grid systems would need to be expanded and upgraded to deliver 
electricity generated from renewable sources, often with new transmission lines connecting the 
sunniest and windiest open spaces to major cities with intensive energy needs. Investment is also 
needed to build generation capacity, at a large scale, as the power sector becomes the backbone 
of the energy system under a net-zero transition.

In many countries, power utilities responsible for building out these assets are public entities. As 
part of its 2021–22 budget, India’s government, for example, announced an additional capital 
infusion of about $150 billion to the Solar Energy Corporation of India to develop more solar 
photovoltaic capacity; the following year saw another increase in solar investment of almost 
30 percent.155 Across China, India, and the rest of Asia (outside of Japan), the need to expand 
the electricity sector while remaining on a net-zero pathway would increase the investment 
need by $6 trillion compared with what would be expected under current policies. Across these 
regions, power sectors have historically relied on financing via state-owned enterprises, and the 
scenario modeled here assumes this remains the case. Combined with concessional and grant 
financing, the public sector would provide $3 trillion of incremental support (above and beyond 
that under current policies), to the power sector in these regions, spurring more private projects. 
A $700 billion, publicly financed step-up takes place in T&D in our scenario. For many countries, 
prioritizing power grids may be the factor determining whether they can carve out a pathway 
toward net zero. 

Some of the other sectors mentioned earlier in this chapter would also need to be part of this 
substantial push to fill the residual gap. The initial waves of subsidies and private investment 
anticipated under current policies are enough to get things moving but not sufficient to complete 
all aspects of the transition or reach into all geographies. Buildings, for example, would need 
sustained public support as some of the key decarbonization technologies, such as heat pumps, 
are not yet cost competitive relative to gas boilers. We estimate that more than $1.5 trillion of 
public funding could mobilize about $3 trillion of private spending in low-emissions heating.

subsidies, convenience, and the assurance that heat pumps, solar panels, and insulation will be 
installed by people who know how to do the work properly.156

Similarly, public support could still be needed in the early part of this decade to generate 
sufficient momentum across the entire globe in mobility. This is the case especially for 
heavy-duty BEVs, which are expected to take longer than passenger BEVs to reach cost 
competitiveness with traditional alternatives (in this case, internal-combustion-engine trucks).157 
To ensure that their adoption is consistent with a net-zero pathway, we estimate that an increase 
in public support of some $200 billion beyond what is expected under current policy frameworks 
could in turn mobilize around $350 billion of additional private spending.

In our scenario, hydrogen-based mobility, green hydrogen production, and the decarbonization 
of heavy industry in particular would rely on public funding to crowd in private investment to 
address their unfilled gaps for the entirety of the decade. The underlying technologies are not 
yet mature, which in turn affects their cost profiles relative to traditional alternatives. It would 
take about $1.9 trillion of additional funding beyond current policies to ensure that these sectors 
progress toward net zero at the required pace; we estimate that societal commitments could 
provide about 40 percent of this sum. Decarbonizing heavy industry in China alone would require 
about $400 billion of this step-up in the scenario analyzed here.   

$4T

in low-emissions spending can be 
avoided through accelerated learning

In our scenario, the remainder of the positive impact from increased societal commitments 
occurs as a by-product of the huge wave of public and private spending described above. This 
would likely lead to faster learning that further lowers the unit capital costs of low-emissions 
technologies for governments, businesses, and consumers. We estimate that these accelerated 
learning effects could lower the total spending needed for the transition by about $4 trillion.158 
Almost three-fourths of this effect in our scenario occurs in the power and buildings sectors. 

In the power sector, about $1.7 trillion of investment could be avoided through accelerated 
learning. Investment in photovoltaic generation could be reduced by about $600 billion, and a 
similar benefit could occur with wind generation. The cost of utility-scale photovoltaic systems 
decreased by 82 percent in the United States from 2010 to 2020, for example.159 But this is not 
the only factor determining whether solar installations are cost-effective for residential and 
commercial consumers. The costs of the labor and other materials needed for these installations 
(known as balance-of-system, or BOS, costs) are country-specific and now account for the 
majority of the price tag attached to photovoltaic systems. But in the years ahead, accelerated 
learning could help lower these BOS costs as well.160

“Decarbonizing medium- and heavy-duty on-road vehicles: Zero-emission vehicles cost analysis,” National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (US), March 2022.

158 Accelerated learning rates are well established in academic literature. However, there is no consensus on the exact 

relationship between increased production and unit cost reductions, and a variety of factors, linked to R&D or to learning by 
doing, may play a role; specific examples include higher labor productivity and “effort,” improved manufacturing methods, 
increased operational experience, optimized system designs, and lower equipment procurement costs. Our analysis does 
not attempt to isolate the impact of specific factors: the term “accelerated learning” refers to multiple dimensions that may 
drive reductions in capital costs. To estimate the magnitude of the accelerated learning, we rely on the work of Way et al., 
who elaborated probability distributions for future costs of key low-emissions technologies. The acceleration in unit capital 
expenditures reduction modeled in our analysis is equivalent to that measured by Way et al., when moving from the median 
unit capital expenditures reduction to the 75th percentile one. Over 2021–30, the average annual unit capital expenditures 
decrease in the low-emissions technologies we analyze is about 1.97% in a non-accelerated learning scenario, and 3.44% in an 
accelerated learning scenario. See Rupert Way et al., “Empirically grounded technology forecasts and the energy transition,” 
Joule, volume 6, number 9, 2022.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthIn the buildings sector, heat pumps are the key lever that would benefit from accelerated 
learning, since they are a relatively new technology with ample room for cost decreases. Heat 
pumps have already enjoyed learning rates of more than 20 percent in some countries.161 In our 
scenario of bolder policies and faster technological progress, their learning rates would be 
expected to continue on that trend, with unit capital expenditures decreasing to 67 percent of 
the 2020 cost by 2030.162 We estimate that savings of about $750 billion could materialize during 
the current decade if unit costs drop substantially. 

Some sectors have more in-the-money opportunities than 
others, which influences the role of different actors 
As shown in Exhibit 23, near the beginning of this chapter, we estimate that one-quarter of the 
total $55 trillion needed in low-emissions spending through 2030 could be fully in-the-money 
spending (plus avoided spending), up from 10 percent in 2020. In total, some $31 trillion could 
potentially come from private actors; this includes what is expected to become cost competitive 
as well as what could be unlocked through additional policies and subsidies. 

Public support alone makes up some 36 percent of the total in this scenario.163 While this 
involves a large increase in absolute terms relative to today’s levels, it would be a decrease 
in the public sector’s relative share, which was about half in 2020, when the vast majority of 
the spending that took place was either fully public or subsidized. Just over 20 percent could 
be delivered through grants and concessional finance (that is, lending on better-than-market 
terms). Projects undertaken by public actors on market terms could account for an additional 
15 percent, with state-owned enterprises accounting for most of this piece (based on their 
historical roles) and development finance institutions making up the remainder.

Most of the total capital needed across sectors can come from private sources, although the 
majority of this would need some level of public subsidies to bridge gaps in cost competitiveness 
and risk. In our scenario, fully viable private spending from businesses and consumers meets 
18 percent of the total need, while private spending crowded in with some type of subsidy could 
account for more than twice that share.

emissions by 2070 and warming limited to 1.8°C. “Cumulative capacity and capital cost learning curve for vapour compression 
applications in the Sustainable Development Scenario, 2019–2070,” IEA, updated July 2, 2020. However, heat pump learning 
rates are not global. See Energy technology innovation: Learning from historical successes and failures, Arnulf Grübler and 
Charlie Wilson, eds., Cambridge University Press, 2014; and Technological learning in the transition to a low-carbon energy 
system, Martin Junginger and Atse Louwen, eds., Academic Press, 2020.

162 This is in line with other projections: in the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario, heat pump unit capex is projected to fall to about 

85 percent of 2020 levels by 2030.

163 As discussed above, this need varies across regions.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthCommercial actors provide the majority of private financing in our scenario; these investors in 
particular take the lead in power, agriculture, and hydrogen (Exhibit 25). Another substantial 
share falls to consumers. As owners of homes and cars, they are the primary actors in buildings 
and mobility. Just as government incentives can crowd in commercial investors, they can 
influence consumer purchases as well—as we are seeing today when governments offer 
programs to lower the cost of home energy-efficiency upgrades and electric vehicles.

One of the major takeaways from our road map toward net zero is the dynamic of public support 
crowding in more private capital. This can occur through grant and concessional funding that 
bridges gaps in cost competitiveness and lowers risks for private actors, or through SOEs 
providing financing. The next chapter considers how much fiscal headroom governments have 
and the tools at their disposal, as well as the implications for helping low- and middle-income 
countries that may lack the resources to pursue these aspirations.

6. A decisive moment: 
Implications and questions 

Economic growth, higher productivity, upskilling for better-paying jobs, and technology 
advances can deliver remarkable progress on empowerment and the net-zero challenge. But 
after maximizing the potential contributions from these forces, significant gaps remain on both 
fronts, as we have described. 

Societies around the world are then left with decisions about whether they have the appetite, 
capacity, and ability to deploy additional resources against those remaining gaps. Countries 
might prioritize one of these transformations over the other, make partial progress on both fronts, 
or leave both priorities unaddressed beyond what market forces can do. 

In chapters 4 and 5, we outlined scenarios in which societies choose to fully close both gaps. This 
involves going beyond what growth and business innovation can do under current frameworks. 
To get to full empowerment, our scenario suggests that $3.5 trillion cumulatively could come 
from enabling more affordable essentials and labor-friendly work arrangements. But that still 
leaves a $10 trillion gap that could likely be addressed only through public support, if societies 
chose to do so. On the net-zero side, the scenario suggests that $10 trillion of incremental 
public support cumulatively to 2030 could unlock an additional $17 trillion of private spending, 
assuming that societies choose to prioritize getting to net zero and private actors respond in full. 

Combining the two scenarios, the additional societal commitments of $20 trillion needed to 
close both gaps in full, cumulative through 2030, would be the equivalent of about 2 percent 
of global GDP annually over the decade. This is over and above what is already being spent (or 
has been committed) from public resources on the twin priorities. The distribution would vary 
across countries. Lower-income regions would need relatively higher commitments of as much 
as 5 percent of GDP on an average annual basis for empowerment and an additional 2 percent to 
unlock the net-zero investments needed (Exhibit 26). 

What form could such societal commitments take?164 On the inclusion side, they could involve 
direct household transfers; greater direct investment in housing, healthcare, and education to 
expand access or improve the affordability of these services; or both. On the sustainability side, 
an additional infusion of subsidies and other incentives could crowd in even more private capital, 

164 Societal commitments can come from governments, state-owned enterprises, multilateral agencies, development finance 

institutions, philanthropies (including corporate social responsibility initiatives), and social investors.

potentially raising private spending and lowering costs to avoid spending. Beyond funding, new 
policies could spur action to close the gaps.

But investments on this scale would demand more attention to maintaining growth and stability. 
Will countries confront the scope and urgency of both needs and choose to take them on? And 
if they do, what are the funding options? This chapter looks at the implications and considers 
potential approaches to address the last-mile gaps. 

What are the options to raise public funds?
While some capital could come from philanthropies, multilateral agencies, and institutions 
or social investors, the bulk of societal commitments would likely come from governments. 
Governments have several options to generate resources for big priorities, depending on their 
choices, their fiscal health, and political feasibility (Exhibit 27).

First and foremost, residents of every country want to ensure that public dollars are being used 
as efficiently and effectively as possible. Governments already spend the equivalent of some 
36 percent of GDP globally on a variety of social, economic, and defense priorities. They have 
substantial opportunities to make existing spending programs more transparent, targeted,  
and productive.165

Digital tools can spot leakages (whether caused by fraud or errors), streamline eligibility 
processes, and deliver benefits more efficiently.166 India’s digital identification structure, Aadhaar, 
for example, linked to mobile bank accounts and reduced leakage in the delivery of benefits to 
the poorest citizens.167 Grassroots community-based approaches could also work. Ethiopia’s 
Productive Safety Net Programme, for instance, follows local cultural norms by delivering 
transfers to local leaders of nomadic clans, who redistribute them to families in need for accurate 
targeting, while Brazil relies on door-to-door community health agents to administer its Bolsa 
Familia safety net program.168

Governments also have the option of reallocating funds from other areas to high-priority 
initiatives that can further empowerment and the net-zero transition. This requires careful 
evaluation and consideration of the potential impacts on other programs or services. Most 
developing nations do not have great flexibility, however. In India, for example, the additional 
societal commitment needed to get on a net-zero pathway is more than 50 percent higher than 
the share of GDP that currently goes to social protection spending, based on IMF data. 

Additional debt or taxes
Countries (and local governments) can also choose to take on more public debt, whether 
through bond issuance or loans. Borrowing enables governments to access immediate funds 
for priority projects, repaying the debt over time with interest. The ability to borrow depends on 
each government’s capacity to manage debt sustainably and, ultimately, on whether growth is 
sufficient to pay for the debt—and these issues are the subject of ongoing debate.169 For Japan 
and the United States, for example, borrowing to cover the societal commitments needed to 
close both gaps in full (after accounting for what growth, innovation, and technology advances 
deliver) would make existing debt-to-GDP ratios go up only modestly. But for sub-Saharan 
Africa, taking this approach would make its debt soar to more than five times 2020 levels as a 
share of GDP. 

Public support to finance empowerment and net-zero investments could also come through 
improved revenue collection. Opportunities for countries to strengthen their tax revenues by

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthpursuing reform in tax administration and compliance are well documented.170 Carbon taxes are 
one targeted option, discussed below. High-income regions could fully close their residual gaps 
with tax revenue increases of less than one percentage point as a share of GDP. The implied 
increase to do the same would be two to five percentage points in China, India, other Asian 
economies, Latin America, and the Middle East, while it would be 30 percentage points in sub-
Saharan Africa.

This exercise is meant to illustrate the dimensions of each of these fiscal solutions and their 
limits. Of course, the solution does not have to be all or nothing. Governments can employ 
a combination of these approaches, tailored to their specific circumstances and working 
within their means. Other options could include introducing user fees for certain services and 
monetizing public assets. Previous MGI research suggests that more than one-third of the assets 
on government balance sheets consist of buildings, infrastructure, and public land of significant 
value that may be understated under current accounting standards. They could provide avenues 
to generate revenues that could be recycled back into national priorities.171

Pricing carbon
Putting a price on emissions gives firms and consumers motivation to change their consumption 
choices. This price could come in different forms, including carbon taxes, cap-and-trade 
regimes, and stricter regulation that puts an implicit price on carbon. 

Carbon taxes could be an efficient tool to contain emissions if they impose costs on all emitters 
that reflect the marginal damage of emissions (the “social cost of carbon”). While they would 
particularly target high-emitting sectors, raising their total costs of production, they would 
encourage all economic actors to switch to low-emissions alternatives or reduce energy use 
altogether. Advocates hold that carbon taxes are uniquely effective because they use market 
forces (incentives) to shift behavior.172 They are also a source of government revenue.

Some scholars have pointed to carbon taxes and subsidies as complements rather than a binary 
choice, especially at early stages of the energy transition.173 Subsidies could help encourage early 
high-risk investments in new technologies, advancing learning; then, once learning advances to 
create viable market alternatives, taxes encourage switching away from high-emissions assets. 
Implementing a carbon tax would also involve setting up monitoring and reporting systems.

The model used in the scenarios in this research assumes that the societal commitment needed 
for the net-zero investment gap is delivered through subsidies; it also assumes that this would 
have the same outcome as discouraging high-emissions spending via a carbon tax. However, 
we did model how the need for additional commitments for both goals would change if carbon 
taxes rather than subsidies were the primary vehicle used.174 To do this, we rely on carbon prices 

170 See, for example, Bernardin Akitoby, “Raising revenue,” Finance & Development, March 2018; “Ten quick steps to unlocking 

tax-revenue collection in rapidly growing markets,” McKinsey & Company, July 2013; Oyebola Okunogbe and Fabrizio Santoro,

2, August 2023; and “Would increased funding for the IRS narrow the tax gap?” Peter G. Peterson Foundation blog, March

Council of Economic Advisers, and two former US Treasury secretaries. See also Gilbert E. Metcalf, Paying for pollution: Why a 
carbon tax is good for America, Oxford University Press, 2019.

1, February 2012.

174 We use carbon prices estimated by the NGFS that range from about $78 per ton of emissions in emerging economies like India 

to about $300 in the United States.

117

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthestimated by the NGFS, which vary by country. For example, its carbon prices per ton of CO2 in 
2030 are $302 in the United States, $162 in China, and $78 in India.

We found that carbon taxes at this level would reduce the need for additional societal 
commitments to reach net zero by 0.4 percent of global GDP (on average annually), from 
1 percent (the latter corresponds to the $10 trillion in additional societal commitments described 
in the net-zero scenario in chapter 5). At the same time, the additional commitments needed 
for empowerment would rise by 0.2 percent of GDP (on average annually) in the absence of 
revenue recycling.175 While carbon taxes could be effective, they could also be regressive in some 
economies, creating a disproportionate burden for low-income households that devote a larger 
share of their overall spending to energy. 

One way to address these potentially regressive effects is through revenue recycling—that 
is, returning the revenues raised through the carbon tax to vulnerable households through 
transfers.176 Revenue from carbon taxes could improve public finances or be explicitly earmarked 
to support vulnerable households, but the feasibility and design could vary by country. 

Another concern for governments is whether imposing a carbon tax could be a competitive 
liability in global markets or even cause industries to relocate to regions without a tax—a 
development that would simply shift emissions rather than reducing them on a global basis. 
However, if a critical mass of countries were to implement similar carbon pricing mechanisms, 
it can keep the playing field level and alleviate those concerns. This would require global 
coordination and alignment of carbon pricing strategies. 

Questions surrounding cross-border assistance
High-income countries might have the resources to make higher commitments. Yet the choice of 
whether to aim for full empowerment, net zero, or both would still involve difficult trade-offs with 
other national priorities. Meanwhile, as noted earlier, achieving full empowerment and a net-zero 
trajectory in the current decade is more challenging for lower- and middle-income countries. 
Debt is problematic for the developing world: the IMF estimates that 60 percent of low-income 
countries are already in debt distress or approaching it.177 

In international forums, the fault lines between countries are becoming more evident, creating 
a new consensus that challenges on this scale need new approaches. At the 2022 UN General 
Assembly, for instance, some representatives noted that wealthy nations have not followed 
through on pledges of international assistance to date.178 At the 2023 COP27 conference, 
others also reiterated that the developing world is responsible for only a fraction of the world’s 

175 About half of the additional $10 trillion in societal commitment would still be needed to close the net-zero investment gap in 

full, even with the presence of carbon taxes. This is because carbon taxes, as applied in our modeling, would help address cost 
competitiveness gaps between low-emissions technologies and traditional alternatives. However, some remaining societal 
commitment would still be needed to support initiatives undertaken by state-owned enterprises, to the tune of about $4 trillion. 
Another step-up of $1 trillion in grant and concessional funding would be needed across all sectors to overcome hurdles to 
private spending that are not simply cost-competitiveness gaps (namely technology and market risks). The inclusion impacts 
are based on changes in private consumption seen in the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) from the 
National Institute of Economic and Social Research (UK), which projects global GDP and other macroeconomic variables in 
different NGFS climate scenarios. We compare NiGEM’s no transition, no physical risk baseline to a net-zero scenario, looking 
forward to 2030. The NiGEM model incorporates NGFS carbon prices as taxes, as well as NGFS energy prices.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthemissions but is disproportionately exposed to the worst effects of climate change.179 The 
gathering ended with a deal to create an international fund to assist low-income countries coping 
with climate disasters.180 This will take time to implement, but our numbers suggest it is worth 
exploring more solutions of this kind.

If sustainability and inclusion are viewed as global projects, the ramifications do not stop at 
national borders. For context, we calculate that if high-income countries were to take on the 
additional societal commitments needed to close the residual empowerment and net-zero gaps 
for the entire world, it would require some 3.5 percent of their GDP on an average annual basis, 
up from less than 1 percent of GDP to bridge only their own gaps. The global financial system 
would need to be geared to managing both larger public debt for high-income countries as well 
as cross-border imbalances in flows of capital that bring their own considerable risks.181 

To help the lowest-income countries achieve these goals, the world could explore a mix of 
solutions that could include cross-border aid, additional mechanisms for assistance from 
multilateral institutions, and debt relief. This is starting to occur within the climate space. The 
Green Climate Fund is the largest vehicle of its type, with $12 billion in capital that has catalyzed 
total investments of $45 billion in developing countries.182 There is also a growing movement 
toward creative debt-for-nature and debt-for-climate swaps.183 In 2021, Belize, for example, 
refinanced its national debt, reducing it by 10 percent in a deal with The Nature Conservancy to 
protect the biodiversity of its barrier reef.184 Ecuador recently bought back some $1.6 billion of 
national debt at a steep discount and sold a $656 million “blue bond” that will generate resources 
for preserving the Galápagos Islands; the bond was backed by guarantees from the Inter-
American Development Bank and the US International Development Finance Corporation.185

These types of approaches would need to be scaled up many times over to tackle the full scope 
of the need, especially if high-income countries were to commit to accelerating not only the net-
zero transition but also empowerment in the developing world. 

Donor countries would also need assurance that their capital is going where it is needed. 
Substantial international transfers would not continue to flow if corruption or inefficiency siphons 
off critical capital. Low-income countries that need international assistance to meet these goals 
would need to strengthen weak institutions where needed and commit to reform and improved 
governance to avoid undermining these global projects. 

Where should the world lean in? 
Investments on this scale would have unknown effects on base economies, which demands more 
attention to maintaining growth and stability. As societies debate whether and how to tackle 
these gaps in a definitive way, two areas stand out as immediate priorities.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthAccelerated growth gives 
governments more fiscal flexibility 
and financing capacity.

The importance of productivity-driven growth cannot be overstated 
Faster growth propels inclusion. High-growth emerging economies have delivered powerful 
proof of this phenomenon. The share of the global population living in extreme poverty declined 
roughly 30 percentage points between 1990 and 2020. 

Globally, the gaps are a significantly higher hurdle in a scenario of baseline growth only 
(averaging 2.7 percent globally), especially for developing countries. 

Accelerated economic growth brightens the picture. Our scenario shows that adding less than 
one extra percentage point of growth—along with innovation that creates effective large-
scale workforce transitions—can shrink the unfilled gaps and therefore size of the societal 
commitment that would be needed to achieve to close them in full (Exhibit 28).186 In India, faster 
growth shrinks the size of those commitments by more than half, to 4.6 percent of GDP. Almost all 
of this is for the net-zero transition, as faster growth alone nearly closes the empowerment gap. 
China would reach full empowerment in this scenario with little to no additional commitments. 
The burden for sub-Saharan Africa would still be high, but it would drop from an amount 
equivalent to 44 percent to 30 percent of GDP.

Meanwhile, the additional commitments that could close residual gaps in full also drop by about 
half for high-income regions in a scenario of faster growth. It would take an amount equivalent to 
less than a half percentage point of GDP annually for the EU and the United Kingdom, Japan, and 
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The United States could close both gaps with an amount 
equivalent to less than one percentage point of GDP in additional societal commitments annually 
with faster growth. 

Accelerated growth can also give governments more fiscal flexibility and financing capacity, 
which affords more choice in funding projects. Achieving growth of 3.4 percent globally 
creates headroom for an additional $31 trillion of debt (as compared to baseline growth alone), 
cumulative through 2030, without increasing debt-to-GDP ratios beyond their 2020 levels.187 
At a global level, and especially for high-income regions, this additional debt capacity exceeds 
the size of the societal commitment to address residual gaps. Yet there are real questions 
regarding whether those countries can assume that kind of debt in practice and where it would 
best be allocated.

186 As in previous chapters, our model assumes baseline global growth of 2.7 percent annually on aggregate (varying by country), 

in line with scenarios developed by Oxford Economics. Our accelerated, or “prosperity,” growth scenario assumes that 
productivity boosts global growth to 3.4 percent annually on aggregate (again, varying by country).

187 According to the IMF, global public debt as a share of GDP was 100 percent in 2020.

For developing economies, the prospects for more people to exit poverty do not hinge solely 
on international aid; they depend crucially on growth. These countries would need to double 
down on productivity, skill development, and technological leapfrogging.188 They may also need 
institutional reforms, from clearer legal frameworks for property rights to stronger oversight that 
prevents leakages of public spending.189 New collaborations may be needed to integrate low-
income countries more fully into global flows of trade, finance, technology, and knowledge. 

The upside is compelling: higher growth and innovation could lead to some 600 million people 
in lower-income regions moving out of poverty and taking significant steps on a longer journey 
toward full economic empowerment. While short of the high aspirations outlined in our research,

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthit would nevertheless create historic progress in human development. Even in the absence of 
greater commitments and international transfers, growth and the actions of businesses can 
unlock real progress that changes lives. 

Innovation at scale is critical for affordability
Relentlessly focusing on technology development is a fundamental part of any pathway to net 
zero. The significant recent drops in the costs of wind and solar power offer reason for hope. 
R&D, learning by doing, and scaling up eventually drive costs down. The rate at which this 
happens is key: If innovation and R&D stall, this could both raise the overall price tag of the 
transition and reduce what could be financed by the private sector. Much of this is within the 
realm of businesses—and they can drive exponential progress. Beyond unlocking trillions of 
in-the-money spending, their efforts could set the stage for breakthroughs that are hard to 
foresee today.

Innovation is essential for inclusion, too. It generates demand for higher skills and thus 
upskilling opportunities, and it brings down the costs of meeting basic needs, from housing 
and food to education and healthcare. Some of this can come from private actors, such as 
improvements in construction productivity or implementing digital technologies to their fullest 
extent across healthcare systems. Others can involve smart policy design or creative programs 
delivered by nongovernmental organizations and nonprofits. UNICEF, for example, has an 
entire Office of Innovation focused on pilot programs and integrating technology into its  
local interventions.

Our analysis in chapter 4 shows that many countries do need to invest in expanding housing 
supply as well as healthcare and education systems—but it is not only about spending more. It is 
also about getting more out of every dollar to deliver essential services with higher quality and 
greater effectiveness. Some countries manage to achieve better results than others with lower 
levels of spending.

Innovation is also needed in a broader sense. Lifting minimum living standards and containing 
climate change would involve sweeping transformations, requiring bold approaches in policy, 
finance, technology, and industry. The possibilities could include creating new multilateral 
financing vehicles; integrating low-income countries into global flows of capital and trade in 
a way that lifts local communities and small businesses; developing sustainable cities with 
affordable housing; strengthening education and healthcare systems worldwide; and designing 
effective carbon markets, including incentives for countries to preserve biodiversity and critical 
carbon sinks. 

Progress toward empowerment and net zero would depend on private actors, governments, and 
nongovernmental organizations and nonprofits combining their capabilities and expertise—and 
thinking without limits about how they can contribute to meeting this moment. Regardless of 
whether countries fully close the gaps, they have real opportunities to get started today on the 
task of building a more stable, prosperous future. Tackling the projects that are already feasible 
without further delay would represent historic progress in and of itself. 

122

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growth 
Our research has put very large numbers against what would need to be done to deliver 
against bold aspirations for inclusion and net zero. While the immediate price tag and the work 
ahead are daunting, they could produce a tremendous, long-horizon payoff in the form of a 
more prosperous, stable world. We recognize the scope of the task, not only in financing but 
also in implementation, scaling up supply chains, and retrofitting enormous systems. We also 
recognize the political realities and the difficulty of shaking off inertia. Countries that decide 
to take on these goals on an accelerated time frame will need an entirely different magnitude 
of public–private cooperation, bolder policies, the right physical and social infrastructure, and 
every last bit of innovation and collaboration the world’s best minds can apply. The world has 
many opportunities waiting right now—and every incremental step advances the continuum  
of progress.

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthSpotlight: Improving 
the quality and 
cost of essentials

We see a number of openings to 
deliver essential goods and services 
more effectively—with greater access, 
better quality, and lower costs. In 
each of these areas, the role of the 
private and social sectors varies 
depending on the country context. 

124

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthFood
Most of the world’s 
poorest populations 
can afford enough food 
to provide calories but 
not a nutritious diet.1

But crises can tip them into hunger. The 
importance of food security was on full 
display when war erupted in Ukraine, 
a major global supplier of wheat and 
other grains. The disruption sent food 
and energy prices soaring worldwide. 
The World Food Programme estimates 
that 345 million people worldwide were 
facing acute hunger by late 2022, up from 
282 million at the start of the year.2

Some government programs directly 
provide food or purchasing power 
to low-income households. Food 
assistance can be offered in a variety 
of forms, including food vouchers, 
cash transfers, and free school meals.3 
India has the some of the largest food 
assistance programs in the world.4 In 
addition to the Midday Meal Scheme, 
which provides all elementary school 
students with cooked lunches, the 
government distributes subsidized food 
commodities to about 800 million people 
in specially designated “fair price” food 
shops.5 In Europe, Estonia, Finland, 
Latvia, Lithuania, and Sweden offer 
universal free meals in schools.6 In the 
United States, the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) provides 
benefits to low-income individuals and 
families, issuing benefits via debit cards 
that can be used to purchase eligible food 
products in retail stores.

Other policy options focus on producers, 
including support to farmers, price 
subsidies, and  price controls. Ghana’s 
fertilizer subsidy program, for example,

was found to boost crop yield by almost 
25 percent.7 In 2019, the EU spent 
€38 billion on direct payments to farmers, 
plus €2.4 billion to support the market for 
agricultural products.8 Public investment 
in irrigation and distribution infrastructure 
can increase yields and reduce spoilage. 
China recently unveiled a five-year plan 
to build out a network of product storage 
and cold chain logistics facilities to meet 
demand for produce and frozen foods.9

While policy can provide support and 
tools, it is ultimately farmers themselves—
whether smallholders or large agricultural 
corporations and food processors—who 
will do the hard work of feeding a global 
population that is expected to reach 
almost ten billion by 2050. 

Farmers will have to meet the challenge 
of boosting production while reckoning 
with climate change. Agriculture and the 
overall food supply chain are a significant 
source of emissions. Farming is also highly 
vulnerable to the destructive impact 
of climate change, including droughts, 
flooding, and severe storms. McKinsey 
has estimated that up to 14 percent of 
global rain-fed cropland was affected 
by moderate to extreme drought in 
2022.10 The world also can’t afford to 
lose more forests, which absorb carbon, 
so the challenge will be boosting yields 
on existing farmland without expanding 
agriculture’s footprint.11

Growers will need to focus on resilience, 
adaptation, and emissions reduction 

125

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthin tandem. Climate-smart agriculture 
is a concept that takes an integrated 
approach to these goals.12 While tilling the 
soil is an ancient practice, new “precision 
farming” approaches that use sensors, 
data, and analytics can guide farmers to 
treat plants and soil according to site-
specific needs in real time, improving crop 
management to boost healthy yields.13

Healthcare
The COVID-19 
pandemic drove home 
just how much health 
matters for individuals, 
society, and the 
global economy. 

Yet the policy debate often frames 
healthcare as a rising cost rather than 
an investment with immense returns. 
Health and growth are inextricably 
linked. One study estimates that 
about a third of economic growth in 
the past century can be attributed to 
improvements in global health.14

Recognizing disparities
Uneven spending across regions has 
created highly unequal healthcare 
systems. In 2019, about 80 percent of 
global spending on healthcare occurred 
in high-income countries, where about 
70 percent of that came from government 
budgets. In low-income countries, 
44 percent of healthcare spending was 
out of pocket, and 29 percent came from 
external aid.15 The residents of developing 
countries pay more than half a trillion 
dollars, or $80 per capita, annually out of 
pocket—costs that can prevent the poor 
from accessing the full care they need  
and limit what they have to spend on 
other essentials.16

These types of disparities manifest 
in varying health outcomes. The gap 
between low- and high-income countries 
in life expectancy is 18 years.17 But high-
income countries themselves have gaps 
in outcomes between rich and poor. The 
United States, for example, has extreme 
geographic disparities influenced by 
both access to care and lifestyle factors 
that are heavily influenced by the broader 
environment. Life expectancy in Hawaii 
is 80.7 years, while in Mississippi, it is 
only 71.9 years.18 In short, where you are 
born plays a major role in determining 
how long you will live. Access to quality 
care is especially critical in developing 

countries, where healthcare systems 
often need to be dramatically expanded 
to cover the full population.

To expand healthcare access, one key 
issue to tackle is the training of medical 
professionals. Africa, for example, 
has almost a quarter of the world’s 
disease burden but only 3 percent of its 
healthcare workers.19 In many countries, 
the lengthy education required to 
become a doctor leaves practitioners 
with substantial debt. However, a number 
of European countries offer free or 
heavily subsidized medical education, 
an approach that removes barriers to 

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthentering the profession and ensures an 
adequate medical workforce. 

The potential of prevention and  
proven treatments
Previous MGI research estimates that the 
global disease burden could be reduced 
by about 40 percent by applying known 
interventions in broader segments of 
populations and with closer adherence 
to the most effective tools available.20 
Achieving this would deliver significant 
health benefits by 2040, including a two-
thirds reduction in child mortality, a drop 
of almost 30 percent in cancer deaths, a 
decrease of almost 40 percent in deaths 
from cardiovascular disease, and more 
than a 60 percent reduction in deaths 
from neglected tropical diseases and 
malaria. For people at middle age, this 
could extend the number of years in good 
health by a decade. Every region in the 
world would experience an improvement 
in this range. 

More than two-thirds of these gains 
could be achieved from prevention—
specifically, by creating cleaner and 
safer environments, encouraging 
healthier behaviors, and addressing 
social factors, as well as broadening 
access to vaccines and preventive 
medicine. The remainder would come 
from treating disease and acute 
conditions with proven therapies.

In low-income countries, MGI research 
found the most cost-effective 
interventions include childhood 
immunizations, prevention and 
treatment of malaria, safe childbirth, 
better nutrition, and cardiovascular 
disease prevention. In middle- and 
high-income countries, the greatest 
health improvements could come 
from prevention and treatment of 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and 
substance-use disorders.

MGI has estimated that focusing on 
known health improvements could 
deliver an incremental economic 
benefit of $2 to $4 for each $1 
invested. The economic benefits 
from these health improvements are 
substantial enough to accelerate GDP 
growth by 0.4 percent every year. This 
could be a significant contributor to the 
higher growth needed to accelerate 
both inclusion and sustainability in  
our scenarios. 

Shifting a greater share of healthcare 
spending to prevention could yield a high 
economic return, since prevention is 
typically less expensive than treatment 
and reduces the need for more expensive 
interventions later on. This approach 
would require substantial changes in 
where and how healthcare is delivered, 
as well as changes to make communities 
healthier environments. 

Continued innovation
Innovation continues to be critical 
to tackling diseases without a 
known cure as well as increasing 
uptake and adherence to proven 
interventions. Realizing the next wave 
of health innovations will require 
ongoing investment in research and 
development from the private sector, 
governments, and research institutions. 
Some of this can come from scientific 
technology breakthroughs, including 
genomics to deliver more targeted 
prevention and treatment; data science 
and AI to detect and monitor disease 
and enhance research; tech-enabled 
delivery for better access to care; and 
advances in the understanding of the 
biology of aging. But even more is 
possible if innovation is also applied 
to reducing the cost of diagnostics, 
medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, 
and treatments.

Housing
Adequate and 
affordable housing is 
a foundational need 
with spillover benefits 
to health, education, 
physical security, and 
economic stability. 

Yet rents and home prices have 
risen far faster than incomes in most 
countries, particularly in cities where 
job opportunities are concentrated.21 
At the heart of the issue is an extreme 
imbalance in supply and demand. 
Population growth, urbanization, and 
rising global incomes are all fueling 
steady demand increases—and the 
housing stock of urban centers around 
the world has not expanded quickly 
enough to keep up.22

The urgency of expanding 
housing stock
In the United States, 46 percent of all 
renter households spend more than 
30 percent of their income on housing—
and a quarter spend more than half.23 
In Europe, at least 100 million low- and 
middle-income residents spend more 
than 40 percent of their income on 
housing.24 The issue is also acute in the 
developing world. As of 2018, more than 
a billion urban residents worldwide lived 
in slums and informal settlements, with 
the largest concentrations in Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa.25

Beyond the stress on individuals and 
families, a lack of affordable housing 
eventually constrains economic 
growth.26 Restrictive zoning laws in the 
most productive cities effectively limit 
the number of workers with access 
to highly productive jobs, decreasing 

127

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthTo start, private-sector builders can 
boost innovation and productivity. 
Productivity within the construction 
sector is consistently poor around the 
world, averaging only 1 percent a year 
globally over the past two decades, 
compared with 2.8 percent for the 
total world economy and 3.6 percent 
in the case of manufacturing.29 While 
cities can create a more efficient 
environment and incentives for 
innovation, construction firms also have 
to up their game. The best performing 
take a value engineering approach 
to the design process, pushing for 
repeatable design elements whenever 
possible. They also avoid delays by 
focusing on procurement and supply-
chain management for just-in-time 
delivery. Digital tools can improve the 
design process and monitor materials, 
labor, and equipment productivity on 
sites. Cloud-based control towers 
can coordinate large-scale, complex 
projects, keeping information flowing to 
owners, contractors, and subcontractors. 
Techniques and data that are readily 
available today can make cost and 
schedule estimates more accurate. 

For their part, cities can unlock land. 
Access to land is typically the biggest 
constraint on housing development 
and one of the major drivers of cost. In 
extreme cases such as San Francisco, 
land can account for as much as 
80 percent of a home’s price. Globally, 
MGI has estimated that unlocking 
land to the fullest extent could 
reduce the cost of owning a standard 
housing unit by up to 20 percent.30 A 
comprehensive citywide mapping and 
inventory exercise can unearth many 
opportunities. Congested cities can 
add housing in a more sustainable way 
by increasing density around transit 
rather than encouraging sprawl and 
longer commutes. This may involve 
redeveloping existing residential

labor mobility—and this effect lowered 
aggregate US growth by more than a 
third from 1964 to 2009.27 Households 
with a disproportionate share of monthly 
income going toward rent or mortgage 
payments have to limit other forms of 
consumption. To give one example, 
an MGI study estimated that curtailed 
consumption in Los Angeles County, 
which has an acute affordable housing 
shortage, depresses the region’s GDP by 
up to 5 percent.28

National and local governments around 
the world often address housing gaps by 
focusing on the demand and financing 
side. Strategies such as housing 

subsidies, privileged financing, and 
various forms of rent control offer 
much-needed relief to the low-income 
households they cover, and they are 
legitimate policy choices if carefully 
designed. But they are expensive to 
sustain, and they do not address the core 
issue of an underlying housing shortfall. 

Supply-side solutions 

It will take a dramatic increase in the 
number of available housing units to 
achieve greater affordability. Previous 
MGI research has focused on several 
supply-side solutions.

128

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthstructures or permitting projects with 
greater density in specific target zones; 
Hong Kong and Seoul, for example, 
have intensified land use around 
transit stops. Another strategy involves 
building infill housing on vacant parcels; 
even dense neighborhoods may have 
empty lots that could serve as viable 
sites. Taxes on idle land can create an 
incentive to build. Where appropriate, 
governments can earmark unused 
public lands for housing development. 

Local governments can also remove 
barriers that impede construction. 
Governance structures should 
represent all stakeholders (not just 
the most entrenched or vocal) and 
streamline the execution of housing 
projects. An empowered agency or 
unit with a mandate to guide housing 
delivery from end to end can accelerate 
progress. In many jurisdictions, well-
intended approval processes add  
delays and development costs. Cities 
can streamline their processes to  
fast-track permitting for affordable 
housing projects. 

While private builders are the major 
players in providing housing, governments 
can also consider expanding public 
housing. Among the cities with best 
practices is Vienna, where roughly 
40 percent of the housing stock is “social 
housing” for people of all incomes, which 
avoids segregating low-income tenants. 
The developments are in desirable areas 
and must meet architectural and livability 
standards. Often half of a project’s units 
are reserved for low-income tenants at 
lower rents, subsidized by higher-income 
tenants paying market rents. The city 
continually builds so that supply keeps 
pace with demand.31

India has taken another approach to 
subsidizing housing. Its PM Awaas Yojana 
program subsidizes down payments for 
the urban poor, giving them the means

to obtain mortgage loans and buy solid, 
decent homes.32 In Thailand, the Baan 
Mankong program aims to help the 
urban poor obtain housing with subsidies 
and low-cost loans to buy or lease land 
or to build or upgrade their homes. It 
pools local resources into collectives 
that negotiate with private owners; this 
approach is making it possible to give 
poor residents a voice in community 
development, including relocation from 
flood-prone areas.33

Housing is not simply an urban issue, 
of course. In rural areas, substandard 
housing can pose additional health 
challenges. Two billion people lacked 
access to safely managed drinking water 
in 2020, while about 3.6 billion people had 
insufficient sanitation services. Achieving 
universal access to both by 2030, one 
of the Sustainable Development Goals, 
requires a fourfold increase in the current 
rates of progress.34

 Education
The developing 
world has made great 
progress in expanding 
access to education, and 
the number of years 
of average schooling 
has been rising. 

But there is much more to do. UNESCO 
estimates that some 244 million children 
between the ages of 6 and 18 are out 
of school around the world, including 
67 million of primary-school age.  
Almost 20 percent of children from ages 
6 to 11 in sub-Saharan Africa are not 
attending school.35

129

From poverty to empowerment: Raising the bar for sustainable and inclusive growthbenefits for themselves and society, 
including better health and quality of 
life, better school completion rates, and 
lower incarceration rates.42 The return on 
investment in such programs is large.43

In a more digital and knowledge-
intensive economy, students need 
more technological exposure and 
critical thinking skills. MGI’s research 
has consistently shown that digital and 
social–emotional skills will be needed in 
the jobs of the future. Governments and 
businesses can work together to create 
more pathways to solid jobs that combine 
classwork with apprenticeship and 
vocational training. 

Finally, enhancing student well-being 
can improve attendance and learning. 
Educational systems can help to meet 
students’ basic needs through school 
meals, well-maintained infrastructure, 
and a stimulating environment; they 
can be a natural delivery mechanism for 
health and other community services. 
Taking a holistic approach to each 
child’s well-being includes focusing 
on their mental and social–emotional 
development, physical activity, and 
opportunities for creativity. 

Getting children into the classroom 
is one thing, but the next generation 
needs better learning outcomes to truly 
be empowered. One measure is the 
learning poverty rate, or the share of 
children who are unable to comprehend 
a simple text by age 10. In 2019, before 
the pandemic hit, the learning poverty 
rate was estimated at 57 percent in 
low- and middle-income countries—and 
UNICEF estimates that it has jumped 
to 70 percent after the school closures 
caused by the pandemic.36 Learning 
losses were also steep in high-income 
countries, but the issue is especially 
acute for children who lacked remote 
learning opportunities while schools 
were closed.

Learning outcomes are highly dependent 
on having effective teachers. But a 
quarter of teachers in developing 
countries lack formal training, and 
current certification programs are not 
always effective.37

In high-income countries, too, learning 
outcomes vary depending on where 
a child lives. In the United States, for 
example, most states provide some 
level of baseline funding to local school 
districts, with the remainder generated 
by local property taxes. This approach 
can bake in existing advantages 
and disadvantages. Residents of 
affluent neighborhoods, through 
property taxes on higher-value homes, 
can fund well-maintained schools 
with full staffing, technology, and 
extracurricular programs; residents of 
poor neighborhoods may not generate 
enough property tax revenue to do  
the same.

How can national and local governments 
and social-sector institutions improve 
learning outcomes and shore up the 
weak spots in education? 

One of the top priorities is recruiting, 
developing, and retaining the highest-
quality teachers and school leaders. 
One of the major drivers of Singapore’s 
journey from poverty to prosperity 
was prioritizing education. Teaching 
is a highly respected, competitive, 
and well-compensated field that 
recruits top students. Teachers receive 
comprehensive training, mentoring in 
the early part of their careers, ongoing 
professional development, and holistic 
performance appraisals. This model 
has produced some of the world’s best 
student achievement results.38 However, 
teacher training programs around the 
world have highly variable results.39

Delivering high-quality instructional 
curriculum to every student is critical 
in countries with few trained teachers. 
Guided systems can focus on literacy 
and numeracy, using evidence-backed, 
standards-aligned curricula and 
assessments. Accelerated learning 
programs can help children who have 
missed segments of schooling catch 
up on literacy and numeracy through 
interactive, activity-based approaches.40 
Kenya’s Tusome program, implemented 
in partnership with the US Agency 
for International Development, ran in 
primary schools across the country with a 
singular focus on improving foundational 
literacy. It revised curricula, provided 
universal access to the content, and 
trained teachers with opportunities for 
continued professional development; 
these interventions produced substantial 
improvements in reading levels and 
comprehension.41

Investing in early childhood learning can 
provide a stronger foundation. Research 
has consistently found that children 
who attend high-quality preschool 
and kindergarten get a head start on 
learning that continues to yield long-term
