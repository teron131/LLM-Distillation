Where to play: Focusing the portfolio

Creating value, 
finding focus

Welcome to the first edition of McKinsey’s Global 
Insurance Report, focused on challenges and 
opportunities for carriers in the global insurance 
industry. In this report, we look back at the past 
year’s developments and ahead to the ways that 
the industry is evolving.

The global pandemic is resurgent with yet another 
wave of rising case numbers and pressure on 
healthcare systems. Its effects on business are no 
less significant. Over the past two years, COVID-
19 has accelerated some trends that look certain 
to reshape the way insurance is underwritten, 
distributed, and managed. At the same time, some 
of the problems that have challenged the industry 
over the past decade have not gone away, and 
the complexity of the macroeconomic environment 
has increased. Revenue growth is limited in 
most regions; intermediaries are capturing more 
value; scale economies are proving elusive; 
and productivity is quite stagnant. As a result, 
economic profit—that is, profit after cost of 
capital—in the insurance industry is practically at 
a standstill. 

The industry’s problems are not lost on capital 
markets. As public investors mark down 
companies’ shares, private investors swoop 
in to acquire closed books, and some insurers 
reconsider their geographical footprints, 
the fundamental structure of the industry is 
coming into question. Insurers now face several 
fundamental strategic questions: How can they 

create more value for shareholders? Can they 
unlock latent demand and improve the customer 
experience? How can they regain momentum on 
the long-running quest to improve productivity? 
Also, what about talent? How can they reimagine 
the employee proposition to attract and retain 
the brightest and best after the pandemic? Finally, 
how can insurers, individually and collectively, 
reframe the role and purpose of insurance 
in society? 

To address these questions, we believe 
the leadership teams of insurance carriers need to 
capitalize on nine value levers:

1.  Make environmental, social, and governance 

(ESG) considerations a core feature of 
the business model.

2.  Regain relevance through product innovation 

and coverage of new risks. 

3.  Enhance and personalize customer 

engagement and experience.

4.  Engage with ecosystems and insurtechs.

5.  Develop new businesses for the digital age.

6.  Scale impact from data and analytics.

7.  Modernize core technology platforms.

8.  Address the productivity imperative.

9.  Reimagine culture, diversity, and ways of 
working to attract and retain talent.

ii

Creating value, finding focus: Global Insurance Report 2022Addressing these nine imperatives will help 
carriers answer strategic questions about “how to 
play.” But the challenges and recent trends facing 
the industry will force some insurers also to think 
about “where to play,” to rebalance their portfolios 
of businesses, and to review their capital allocation 
accordingly, in particular through M&A and asset 
disposals. At the end of this report, we focus on 
this pressing question: Where should insurers be 
active (in terms of geography, lines of business, 
and position in the value chain) to renew value 
creation and themselves? The recent wave of sales 
of noncore businesses to buyers with different 
business models suggests that a secular change 
may be in the works. We might be witnessing 
a period when the quest for economies of scale 

and breadth of footprint, a common strategic 
thrust of the past decades for many insurers, 
yields to a more rigorous search for a company’s 
true source of competitive advantage. 

To form a strategy that addresses the challenges 
of this period of intense flux, carriers will need to 
put focus and local scale at center stage. Insurers 
that can develop a tightly defined business 
model and take advantage of the trends and 
currents unleashed by the global pandemic can 
restart growth, expand performance on multiple 
dimensions, and renew themselves through value 
creation, securing an industry-leading position in 
the years to come. 

Where should insurers 
be active to renew value 
creation and themselves?

Welcome to  
a new world

The past two years may have been the most 
peculiar recession and recovery in living memory. 
In 2020, the human tragedy of the COVID-
19 pandemic triggered a global economic 
downturn that was initially sharper than the Great 
Depression. As government support programs 
took shape, the recession rapidly bottomed out, 
leading to a strong economic recovery in 2021. 
Global financial markets took a roller-coaster ride 
as well. 

The impact on the insurance industry was 
noticeable: in 2020, premium growth slowed 
to approximately 1.2 percent (compared with 
more than 4 percent per year between 2010 and 
2020). Profits fell by about 15 percent from 2019. 
The decline was sharpest in Asia–Pacific (down 
36 percent) and was particularly driven by falling 
profits in life (Exhibits 1 and 2). 

Preliminary data suggest that premium growth and 
profits rebounded in 2021, especially in regions 
where strong vaccine rollouts have made many 
activities possible again, at least periodically.

post-COVID-19 world

In coming years, the global insurance industry will 
be profoundly shaped by some megatrends that 
have emerged and accelerated since February 
2020. Some are shifts in the macroeconomy; 
others are changes in competitive dynamics. 
The most dramatic may be changes in customer 
and employer behaviors. While most of these 
trends are not completely new, they have 
accelerated during the pandemic. In aggregate, 
they are shaping a new operating environment 
for insurers that is hugely disruptive and that 
challenges traditional ways of value creation. 
These trends, in brief, include the following: 

 — A decoupling of macroeconomic 

environments among Asia, Europe, and 
North America, whether through elevated 
geopolitical and trade tensions or different 
interest rate trends between regions. (For 
example, while the situation remains highly 
ambiguous, the United States may be exiting 
the “low for long” rate environment on the back 
of a noticeable though perhaps transitory 
spike in inflation). In areas where low rates 
continue to prevail, this could put even more 
pressure on life insurers to revamp their 
business models accordingly. 

 — A dichotomy between ‘winners’ and ‘losers,’ 

reinforced by the crisis. The economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has varied 
considerably by geography (for example, Asia, 
Europe, and North America are recovering at 
different speeds); by sector (for example, travel 
and hospitality suffered a deep recession, 
whereas e-commerce companies soared); 
and within each sector (resulting in intense 
M&A activity). The past two years have thus 
reinforced the superstar phenomenon1—the 
growing concentration of economic success—
that we have observed not just among 
companies but also in cities, economic sectors 
such as insurance, and other aspects of 
the global economy. Among the world’s largest 
companies, economic profit is distributed 
unequally along a “power curve,” with the top 
10 percent of firms capturing 80 percent of 

it. The insurance industry has not escaped 
this trend, moving from a moderately value-
creating industry to one that destroys value—
and the trend is even stronger at the company 
level. Half of insurers globally are not earning 
their cost of capital, and half are trading below 
book value.

 — A potential anchoring of remote-interaction 

models with customers. The pandemic 
saw a “decade in days” acceleration in digital 
uptake—for example, e-commerce sales in 
the United States grew as much in the first 
half of 2020 as in the previous ten years.2 Tech 
players’ platforms strengthened their position 
as go-to places for customers. The frequency 
of interactions and the level of personalization 
have dramatically changed, and insurers 
need to ensure they stay relevant and can 
craft truly personal, needs-based contextual 
experiences. This situation will probably 
provide tailwinds for insurtechs and other 
digital attackers, raising the risk of disruption 
for incumbents. To fend off the threat, insurers 
will need to make additional IT investments 
to digitalize and automate their processes; if 
the trend persists, they might even need to 
significantly modify their distribution models 
by repositioning the roles of agencies, brokers, 
and digital sales channels.

 — An increased awareness of sustainability, 
climate change, and issues of diversity, 
equity, and inclusion (DE&I). Corporates 
and customers alike have become attuned to 
a broader range of environmental and energy 
issues, as well as situations of social, racial, 
and generational injustice. This will have 
an immediate impact on insurers, particularly 
in their investment and underwriting portfolios, 
as governments set target dates to reach 
net-zero emissions. In addition, natural 
catastrophes abounded in 2020 and 2021, 
leaving insurers wondering whether these 
patterns represent extraordinary activity 
or the new normal—in which case, they will 
need to examine whether their pricing models 
adequately account for these events.

Creating value, finding focus: Global Insurance Report 2022Several megatrends are shaping 
a new operating environment for 
insurers that is hugely disruptive 
and that challenges traditional 
ways of value creation.

 — New challenges to the purpose and 

relevance of insurers. Just as the financial 
crisis of 2007–09 put the spotlight on 
the banking industry, the pandemic and 
its associated insurance issues have put 
the spotlight on the insurance industry. This 
might prompt insurers to rethink their societal 
purpose and relevance in the economy as 
a risk-taking industry. There is a perception 
that the industry has lost this characteristic in 
the past ten years by limiting the types of risks 
or clients it covers (as seen in Europe, where 
life insurance has moved sharply toward unit-
linked products).

 — A rethinking of mobility. Commercial aviation 
and other forms of travel fell sharply over 
the past two years; shared mobility3 and 
micromobility4 fell, then resumed their steady 
rise. Next steps might include a rebalancing 
among modes of transport; for example, 
COVID-19 habits might result in a continued 
preference for individual car use over public 
transport but also in less driving overall as 
people continue to work from home. This 
might encourage insurers to reexamine 
their product offerings on severely affected 
lines of business (such as life, travel, and 
events) and to innovate. For example, they 
might cover emerging mobility needs, make 
new use of telematics, or engage in mobility 
ecosystems5—being thoughtful and realistic 

about their role in a world increasingly 
dominated by platform companies.

 — A renewed focus on health and well-being 
and a greater interest in home nesting. 
The ongoing health crisis could leave a mark 
on consumers’ psyches for a generation and 
could inspire insurers to actively participate 
in health and protection ecosystems.6 At 
the same time, consumers are now hooked on 
“home nesting,” or leisure activities at home 
(such as cooking, DIY projects, meditation, 
and streaming entertainment). According to 
the McKinsey Global Institute, home nesting 
is one of the new behaviors most likely to 
endureafter the pandemic.7 In response, 
insurers might invest in smart-home8 services 
and offerings such as discounts on homes 
equipped with devices that can detect fire, 
flood, or unwanted visitors.

 — The dawn of new ways of working. Almost all 
companies are trying to figure out new hybrid 
working models9; so are many professions that 
have close contact with customers. This will 
have a huge impact on the insurance industry. 
Carriers will have to identify the skills required 
to manage remote and hybrid teams10 and 
review their real estate needs—both to adjust 
to a changing workforce and to match clients’ 
new geographical footprints (for example, 
as people move to midsize cities, suburbs, 
and exurbs).

State of the 
industry 

Old challenges still loom
Even before 2020, the insurance industry faced 
challenges. Now, those issues have taken on even 
greater urgency:

 — Headwinds on revenue growth. Three 

structural factors are challenging industry 
growth (Exhibits 3 and 4): persistent low 
interest rates, which pressure spread-based 
businesses such as life insurance; pricing 
pressures driven by fee transparency, digital 
attackers, and lower-cost options—pressures 
that in some markets are aggravated by price 
comparison websites; and organic demand 
that is growing only slowly in mature markets. 
The latter is particularly worrying, because 
growth in developed economies is coming 
mostly from price increases rather than from 
volume or new risks covered, highlighting 
a risk that the industry might lose its relevance 
over time.

Insurtechs are driving digital innovation and 
disruption in the industry,11 with investments 
in insurtechs worldwide growing from 
$1 billion in 2004 to $7.2 billion in 2019 to 
$14.6 billion in 2021. More than 40 percent 
of insurtechs are focused on the marketing 
and distribution segments of the insurance 
value chain (Exhibit 5), enabling them to 
solve customer pain points through a digitally 
enhanced client experience that could pose 
a competitive threat to incumbents. And while 
some of these players have seen their share 
price tumble since their IPOs, we believe that 
a distinctive digital customer experience—from 
attackers or incumbents—will be a prerequisite 
for industry-beating growth. And beyond 
distribution, superior technology and healthy 
margins in insurance service businesses will 
challenge the traditional approach of many 
insurers to own the whole value chain—they 
will be forced to form partnerships or make 
outsize investments to keep up.

 — A value shift toward intermediaries. Over 
the past five to ten years, brokers have 
emerged as the clear winners of the industry, 
with both public and private investors 
recognizing their position of strength in 
the insurance value chain (Exhibit 6). Total 
shareholder returns are much higher for 
brokers than for other industry segments, and 
private-equity firms are investing.12 In 2019, 
for example, CVC Capital Partners invested in 
April, and GTCR invested in AssuredPartners. 
PE-backed brokerage deals completed in 
the United States accounted for roughly 
three-quarters of all insurance transactions 
from 2016 to 2019. Because insurers do not 
control their distribution channels as tightly as 
other financial sectors (though it depends on 
the region and line of business, as illustrated in 
Exhibit 7), they might run an even greater risk 
of becoming pure balance-sheet providers, 
while intermediaries keep an asset-light client 
relationship model. The shift toward digital is 
perhaps the last chance for insurers to regain 
the upper hand in this “fight for the customer.”

scale in recent years. In North America, for 
example, increased scale was a primary 
goal for 60 percent of recent acquisitions.13 
The results have been meager: globally, scale 
does not seem to be producing higher ROE 
(Exhibit 8). It turns out that trying to achieve 
scale on a global level has been a recipe for 
becoming average. 

Importantly, this does not hold true for local or 
national scale effects; on these levels, scale is 
correlated with profitability (Exhibit 9). 

The fragmentation of the industry in several 
countries (Exhibit 10), coupled with this 
scale effect at the local level, could present 

an opportunity for a value-creating wave of 
local consolidation in the industry.

 — Limited productivity improvement. Though 
many insurers have undertaken cost savings 
programs, the aggregate results have not 
been fruitful. Industry-wide, productivity 
improvements have been limited.14 Exhibit 11 
offers an illustration: between 2014 and 2019, 
expense ratios fell for only 45 percent 
of global P&C carriers (with important 
variations across regions). For many, ratios 
did not budge or actually rose. That’s 
a disappointing outcome for an industry that 
has communicated so much on the need for 
productivity improvements.

Together, these elements explain the industry’s 
limited value creation recently. Exhibit 12 shows 
the “power curve” distribution15 of economic profit 
of every sector in the economy. Not only has 
the overall insurance industry destroyed value in 
the past years, but its positioning has eroded from 
2005–09 to 2015–19 (with insurance brokers as 
the exception). 

Looked at another way, industry average ROEs 
have remained at or slightly below the cost of 
equity over the past years, notably in North 
America and Western Europe (Exhibit 13).

Economic profitability has slumped in several regions. 

This is not a problem caused by a few 
underperformers. Rather, it is industry-wide: 
54 percent of listed insurers, representing 
52 percent of the global industry’s equity, 
had an ROE below their cost of equity over 
the past five years (Exhibit 14), raising questions 
about the long-term economic viability of their 
business model.

Not surprisingly, investors in the public markets 
have taken note. Worldwide, about 50 percent 
(depending on region and lines-of-business focus) 
of listed insurance companies have consistently 
traded below their book value over the past 
five years (Exhibit 15). This is clearly a vote of no 
confidence in the industry and raises questions 
about the long-term future of several players as 
stand-alone entities—particularly in multiline, 
where about 60 percent of players are trading 
below book value.

In summary, after decades of stable returns, 
insurance is now a value-destroying industry in 

which half the players do not earn their cost of 
equity. What can insurers do to beat the odds 
and emerge from the current environment as 
winners? Our research16 across insurance and 
other sectors has found that five bold moves, 
pursued persistently, can propel players up 
the power curve: dynamically reallocate capital 
among businesses; reinvest a substantial share 
of capital into organic growth and innovation; 
pursue thematic and programmatic M&A (but not 
megadeals); enhance underwriting margins; and 
make game-changing improvements to achieve 
top-quartile productivity. All of this has to be 
done in a very different and rapidly changing 
environment, and starting points vary greatly 
among geographies and lines of business. 

To acknowledge these differences and capitalize 
on the tailwinds of change outlined above, we 
have identified nine levers that insurers can pull to 
improve value creation.

Strategic 
imperatives 
for insurers

So far we have sketched the trends and challenges 
buffeting the industry. Their effects run so 
deep that insurers now face some fundamental 
strategic questions: 

 — How can we improve shareholder 

value creation?

 — How can we unlock latent demand and improve 

customer experience?

 — How can we overcome 

stagnating productivity? 

 — How can we reimagine the employee 

proposition to attract and retain talent post-
COVID-19? 

 — How can we frame the industry’s wider 

purpose and role in society?

21

Creating value, finding focus: Global Insurance Report 2022Answering these questions is an urgent and 
broadly transformational task. In our view, it 
can be best accomplished by taking action on 
the following nine imperatives: 

 — Make environmental, social, and governance 

(ESG) considerations a core feature of 
the business model. ESG issues increasingly 
affect how all companies do business. More 
and more companies and their investors 
are recognizing ESG as a strategic priority 
that involves significant business risks and 
opportunities. In interactions with many 
stakeholders, including at annual general 
meetings of publicly listed insurers, ESG has 
become a major theme. 

But ESG is often used as a catchall term 
covering many topics; for any given company, 
just a handful of those topics will be of 
supreme importance. As an illustration, 
consider climate risk, an area in which 
evidence is mounting that P&C insurers will 
soon need to revisit their business models.17 
However, while many insurers have begun 
to incorporate climate-risk considerations 
in their investment processes, new-product 
launches and underwriting processes are 
mostly unchanged. With climate risk mounting, 
insurers have an opportunity to broaden 
the relevance of the industry’s traditional risk 
transfer to explicitly address risk mitigation. 
Five simultaneous actions can make this 
happen: stress-test total exposure against 
projected climate hazards; build resilience 
and rebalance portfolios; help organizations 
mitigate climate risk; create innovative 
products to address climate-related risk; and 
revise investment strategies.

 — Regain relevance through product 

innovation and coverage of new risks. 
While the insurance industry has improved its 
resilience and solvency in recent years, some 
substantial risks have been left uninsured. 
A fast-changing world is creating many 
new and evolving risks—cyberrisks, climate 
change, pandemics, intangible assets—that 
remain underinsured, while other risks have 
been gradually transferred to governments 
to handle. 

Risks are rapidly evolving. In P&C commercial 
lines, for instance, data and cybersecurity risk 
and machine-learning liability are coming to 
the fore. New risks call for new products and 
a reallocation of priorities, and they represent 
significant opportunities for P&C and life 
insurers that are willing to innovate. Such firms 
are taking three steps: making their products 
modular, reallocating capital between 
personal and commercial lines, and moving 
quickly to establish strong market positions in 
the new risks. 

As noted, climate risk will require product 
innovation. But even more innovation is 
necessary as the insurability of entire regions 
may come into question.18 As our colleagues 
have written, “The P&C industry can address 
this issue by forming an industry-wide 
coalition and collaborating more closely with 
governments and regulators.”19 At the very 
least, requiring customers to opt out of 
protection, rather than the current model 
of opting in, could substantially increase 
insurance penetration, as behavioral 
science has shown. This raises the issue 
of affordability; on that front, rather than 
artificially suppressing risk-based rates, 
governments and insurers might need stronger 
public–private partnerships, including 
government insurance voucher programs to 
address affordability issues without losing 
the highly valuable pricing mechanism 
that signals risks back to the insured (for 
example, to prevent building in areas with high 
flood risk).

 — Enhance and personalize customer 

engagement and experience. New customer 
behaviors require a shift in distribution. 
Consumers are embracing digital channels and 
have become used to delightful experiences 
with leading tech companies. They expect 
the same when buying insurance both online 
and offline. A seamless, consistent “multi-
access” experience20 in every channel is now 
the gold standard for insurers. At the same 
time, most customers still expect some form of 
advice on most products. Addressing customer 
needs and improving customer experience 
thus does not necessarily mean going direct. 
It might mean supporting distributors with

let customers decide which topics they can 
access digitally themselves and on which 
topics they value personal advice (for example, 
before buying a complex and low-frequency 
product or in the case of a severe claim).

Major European and US carriers have not 
moved as quickly as some players in Asia that 
have seamlessly linked their digital platforms 
and tied agent channels and invested in 
customer personalization and engagement. 
Carriers willing to launch this journey could 
follow different approaches based on their 
strengths and organizational capabilities. Many 
insurers that traditionally rely on agents start 
by providing digital tools to agents. Insurers 
that depend on direct distribution are typically 
far down the road of digitalization; they can 
augment direct channels with tools to connect 
customers with people. Carriers that rely on 
both an agent network and direct channels 
can build a true multi-access model that fully 
integrates both agent and direct channels. 

 — Engage with ecosystems and insurtechs. 
The ongoing drive toward digitalization has 
also put the insurance industry on the verge 
of a paradigm shift: as traditional industry 
borders fall away, ecosystems will greatly 
influence the future of insurers, with insurtechs 
aiming to play a role in this recomposition of 
the value chain. Our research suggests that 
ecosystems could encompass $60 trillion in 
revenue by 2030.21

Many insurance executives are looking at 
ways to engage with emerging ecosystems 
in areas such as mobility, healthcare, 
and the connected home. While only 
the very largest insurers will be able to 
create or orchestrate their own ecosystems, 
the ability to connect with ecosystems will 
be a prerequisite for growth for all carriers as 
these systems gain in scale and customers 
come to expect insurance products as part of 
the offering. 

Carriers will need to take a close look at their 
relationships with end customers in the context 
of purchasing journeys—such as buying a car, 
going on vacation, and buying a home—and 
decide how to embed solutions and services 
alongside insurance coverage. To succeed, 
insurers need to build the technological 

and organizational foundations as well as 
the necessary partnerships to generate 
value from their ecosystem approaches. Our 
conversations with insurance executives 
around the world suggest that leading carriers 
take a three-stage approach22 to participating 
in or forming an ecosystem: strategize, 
enable, and generate value. These stages 
can help insurers implement ecosystems in 
manageable, focused phases.

 — Develop new businesses for the digital age. 
Private investors have spotted the potential 
for improvement and the not-too-distant 
prospect of attractive returns in insurance. 
They are investing heavily in insurtechs, whose 
attractive talent pools can rapidly create and 
scale new businesses. 

In this context, incumbent carriers must 
reinvent their business models to fulfill 
the imperative to grow and, ultimately, to 
deliver stakeholder value. As our colleagues 
wrote recently, “New-business building is 
emerging as a crucial strategic priority to drive 
reinvention and innovation for the industry. 
Part of the reason is speed: what used to take 
years must now be done in months or weeks 
to meet changing demands of the market. 
Insurance executives must shift how they lead 
their institutions—from a methodical pace 
of change to the decisive reinvention of their 
businesses. Many established companies 
have tried and failed to build new businesses 
from scratch. The ones that succeed combine 
the speed of a start-up with the scale and 
resources of the core business.”23 

Organizations that repeatedly build successful 
new businesses exhibit six characteristics: 
strong commitment from senior management, 
obsession with value over ideas, a test-and-
learn culture, “open architecture” capabilities, 
balance between organizational freedom and 
corporate support, and dynamic performance 
management and measurement. To get 
started on new-business building, insurers 
can look for opportunities that simultaneously 
meet customer demands, square with 
the organization’s strengths, and are sizable 
enough to create real value.

 — Scale impact from data and analytics. Most 
insurance executives would agree that data 
and analytics capabilities are becoming table

North America, and Asia.24 Leaders see 
enormous potential in best-in-class data and 
analytics capabilities across the value chain, 
even for the highest-performing companies. 
For example, even the leading P&C insurers 
can see loss ratios improve three to five 
points, new business premiums increase 
10 to 15 percent, and retention in profitable 
segments jump 5 to 10 percent. However, 
after years of investing and experimenting, 
most insurers have not yet seen the return on 
their investments at the enterprise level. While 
individual pilots are successful, they realize 
the real challenge is in scaling the impact to 
the whole organization. We call this the pilot 
trap; to escape it, insurers need to move 
analytics from experiments to the mainstream. 

This move requires a combination of distinctive 
analytics, tools, frontline and management 
routines, and investments in talent and 
capability building. The ideal mix of these 
elements will vary by line of business. Based 
on our experience with similar efforts, getting 
a few things right often determines whether 
companies achieve their full potential. One 
principle is to start small to learn and build 
conviction—for example, by picking two lines 
of business, one with strong performance 
and another that is performing less well, to 
prove impact. “Big bang” efforts made without 
examples of the potential outcome often 
fail to drive change. Another guideline: keep 
the effort anchored in the C-suite; delegating 
down can dilute long-term aspirations. Carriers 
should also focus on the pace of execution: 
in other words, speed is a strategy, especially 
in the next 18 to 24 months, given evolving 
market conditions. Fourth, carriers should 
engage the front line throughout the effort 
to help ensure lasting change; adoption by 
users is the foundation for success. Finally, it’s 
a good idea to link capital allocation decisions 
to the latest market intelligence and insights 
(at a high enough frequency to ensure you can 
react to market shifts).

At the same time, technology is evolving 
quickly. The next level will be to leverage 

even more advanced technologies to 
enhance decision making and productivity, 
lower costs, and optimize the customer 
experience: as AI becomes more deeply 
integrated25 in the industry, carriers need to 
understand the potential for AI to reshape 
claims, underwriting, pricing, and distribution. 
With this understanding, they can build 
the skills and create the culture needed for 
an AI-powered future.

 — Modernize core technology platforms. 
From 2012 to 2020, technology’s average 
share of operating costs rose by 36 percent 
for P&C and 10 percent for life. The key driver 
is increasing digitalization—at both the front 
end, where technology enhances the customer 
experience, and the back end, where digital 
drives productivity gains and operational 
performance. Digitalization is straining legacy 
systems, some of which are decades old, and 
many insurers are considering a replacement 
of core systems with tech platforms that 
support the requirements of the digital age. 
The challenge is that such projects can take 
five to ten years, and they often last longer 
and cost more than expected. Insurers 
need to clearly pinpoint the real business 
requirements, quantify the effects, and 
then identify the tech changes required to 
achieve them. A wholesale change of all core 
systems is not always the right answer, and 
the long timeline of such a change can prevent 
carriers from adjusting to rapidly changing 
market conditions. 

To reach the next normal of core technology,26 
carriers will need to take three bold actions: 
reimagine the relationship between the IT 
group and other business functions, reinvent 
the ways that IT delivers products and services 
to internal customers, and anticipate the future 
requirements of technology systems to provide 
the organization with essential capabilities (but 
without necessarily undertaking a complete 
change of the IT stack).

 — Address the productivity imperative. In 

the current conditions, addressing structural 
expenses27 has become an even more 
important source of value—especially given

24

Creating value, finding focus: Global Insurance Report 2022the limited progress to date. Total expenses 
relative to total revenues (including investment 
income) increased by 20 percent from 2003 to 
2019 for the life and annuities industry and by 
6 percent for P&C insurance carriers. During 
these same years, automakers and telecoms 
companies successfully reduced their total 
expense ratios by 15 percent or more.28 

Insurers need more than mere piecemeal 
attempts at improvements. Only 
a transformative approach29 will allow 
an insurer to survive and thrive in a post-
COVID-19 world. Each carrier is unique, but 
any company can begin the process to improve 
productivity by establishing the trajectory 
and full performance potential of the business 
across the value chain—including sales and 
distribution, product development, operations, 
technology, and corporate functions. 

With a clear vision, insurers can write 
a comprehensive and detailed plan with clear, 
measurable goals and assign responsibility to 
specific executives. Financial, operational, and 
customer-experience targets are all in scope. 
Examples include straight-through processing 
rates and all-digital policy application and 
issuance rates in underwriting. Without both 
clear goals and accountability, transformations 
often deliver poor results. 

To do the work, insurers should build a team 
to continually and logically sequence all 
the improvement initiatives so that every part 
of the organization knows what to do and 
when to do it in a harmonized way. A senior 
executive should lead the team, holding people 
accountable for their actions and their results. 
The keys to success of such a productivity 
transformation are top-management 
conviction, leadership to challenge prevailing 
orthodoxies and drive step-change 
performance improvements, and a rigorous 
execution machine that ensures delivery (and, 
where required, adaptation) of initiatives.

 — Reimagine culture, diversity, and ways of 
working to attract and retain talent. Our 

colleagues summed it up recently: “Once in 
a generation (if that), we have the opportunity 
to reimagine how we work. In the 1800s, 
the Industrial Revolution moved many in 
Europe and the United States from fields to 
factories. In the 1940s, World War II brought 
women into the workforce (if not the C-suite) 
at unprecedented rates. In the 1990s, 
the explosion of PCs and email drove a rapid 
increase in productivity and the speed of 
decision making, ushering in the digital age as 
we know it today. And in 2020, the COVID-19 
pandemic drove employees out of offices to 
work from home. ... The return to the workplace 
is a chance to create a new, more effective 
operating model that works for companies 
and people navigating a world of increasing 
uncertainty. There is, however, one big catch: 
employers must confront the broadening 
disconnect between how they and their 
employees see the future.”30 Because of this 
disconnect, a record number of employees 
are quitting or thinking about doing so (the 
so-called Great Resignation).31 

Many companies don’t really understand why 
their employees are leaving. Without knowing 
the true causes of attrition, companies 
sometimes offer pay raises and bonuses that 
fall flat. Rather than sensing appreciation, 
employees sense a transaction. Leaders need 
to start from scratch, question everything, and 
make changes to the working model based on 
the evidence. 

There is no road map or playbook for this 
unprecedented time. Experimentation will be 
key. Carriers can try different working models 
and norms, physical-space layouts, and tools 
in service of a future that balances productivity 
with creativity, personal flexibility with team 
collaboration, and the office with the home. 
That means experimenting and piloting as 
individuals, teams, business units, offices, and 
organizations. Letting experiments play out is 
not easy for many leaders. A clear solution may 
not be immediately apparent—the big answers 
may not emerge for years.

Where to play: 
Focusing the 
portfolio

Above, we outlined nine essential actions for 
leaders to renew their companies and rejuvenate 
value creation. While addressing these imperatives 
would enable carriers to answer the “how to play” 
question, we believe a related question is equally 
pressing: Where should companies play—in terms 
of geography, lines of business, and position in 
the value chain—to renew themselves? 

The pandemic years seem to herald a new phase 
for the insurance industry. Several players are 
already changing and refocusing their footprint 
and business model—in effect, rebalancing their 
portfolio of activities and reviewing their capital 
allocation particularly through M&A and asset 
disposals. Indeed, a new premise for industry 
transformation may be emerging as carriers 
realize that the changes unleashed by the COVID-
19 crisis will raise the stakes of competition 

27

Creating value, finding focus: Global Insurance Report 2022while also complicating the macroeconomic 
environment, especially through inflation and 
interest-rate evolution. Carriers have to invest 
quickly and massively in technology, data and 
analytics capabilities, digital skills, the customer 
experience, and compliance capabilities just to 
keep pace in the changing environment. Those 
investments won’t be easy to fund in an industry 
with some disappointed shareholders. And 
they carry an opportunity cost: as carriers with 
diversified portfolios have many mouths to feed, 
some areas will be shortchanged.

Insurers are realizing that the costs of 
complexity (whether in the product portfolio, 
client experience, geographical footprint, lines 
of business, or position in the value chain) are 
simply too high. More carriers are concluding 
that it is better to simplify their operating model, 
cede some benefits of diversification, and 
invest the proceeds to gain scale where they 
intend to operate. Thus, many carriers (though 
not all; some are still pursuing global scale) are 
shedding subscale, noncore businesses; seeking 
profitability in their core activities and markets; 
and gaining the ability to make bolder, more 
focused investments. Many carriers believe they 
will be able to renew value creation by offloading 
legacy liabilities to owners better positioned 
to manage them and by refocusing their 
business model. 

Consider a flurry of recent deals, each with focus 
and local scale as the core strategic rationale. 
Voya Financial recently sold its annuities, 
life, and wealth businesses and doubled 
down on retirement, asset management, and 
group insurance. MassMutual, meanwhile, 
divested its US direct-contribution business, 
OppenheimerFunds, and its businesses in 
Asia. Concurrently, it doubled the size of its 
captive channel through an acquisition and then 
acquired American Financial Group’s annuities 
business to secure product scale in its core 
insurance business. 

Financial buyers have also entered the arena. 
Private equity firms are rolling up insurance 
and annuities assets32—typically sold by public 
carriers—to secure permanent capital for their 
investment arms. Recent deals include Apollo’s 
acquisition of Athene, KKR’s deal for Global 
Atlantic, Generali’s sale of its Generali Leben book 

to Viridium, and Athora’s acquisition of VIVAT life 
and asset management from Anbang. And some 
global insurers have rethought their geographical 
footprint; for example, AXA has sold its activities 
in Central and Eastern Europe, Greece, the Gulf 
region, Malaysia, and Singapore; Aviva has sold 
most of its international businesses, including 
operations in France, Italy, Poland, Singapore, and 
Turkey; and Aegon has divested its businesses in 
Central Europe and Turkey.

The next phase of M&A

The overall pace of M&A activity among insurers 
and investors is likely to increase, though we 
anticipate more activity among life insurers than 
P&C. For life insurers, industry consolidation is 
largely the result of macro challenges, including 
sustained low interest rates and others that make 
it difficult to achieve an attractive, sustainable 
ROE. P&C insurers also face headwinds from 
low interest rates—although less so than 
their life insurance counterparts—as well as 
an overabundance of carriers in many businesses, 
resulting in downward pressure on ROE. 

As the industry continues to restructure, 
making a series of small deals could be a bridge 
to a programmatic approach to acquisitions 
for P&C and life insurers.33 Our research over 
the past 20 years has consistently shown that 
a programmatic approach increases carriers’ 
odds of success as well as their potential for long-
term independence—if they can resist the allure 
of very large acquisitions. Across industries, 
programmatic M&A has worked best when 
companies build dedicated teams and carefully 
design processes based on best practices across 
all stages of the M&A process, from strategy and 
sourcing to due diligence and integration planning. 
Today’s deal pace is strong; as that continues, 
leading carriers can adopt those best practices to 
fulfill their growth needs.

Both life and P&C insurers could focus on M&A in 
existing businesses, and they could also increase 
their presence in truly adjacent areas, as long as 
they do not wander too far afield. For example, life 
insurers could expand in businesses related to 
asset and wealth management; P&C carriers could 
move into service-provider functions in personal, 
commercial, or specialty lines.

Creating value, finding focus: Global Insurance Report 2022Embracing a strategy 
of focus and local 
scale will require a 
hard look at global 
insurers’ portfolios of 
activities, as well as 
some tough decisions.

How to (re)focus portfolios 
of activities

Over the past several years, most global 
insurers’ strategies have centered on four areas: 
productivity, economies of scale and scope, 
greater exposure to higher growth markets, and 
the benefits of diversification (including the impact 
of Solvency II). As previously mentioned, these 
moves have not yet been sufficiently radical to 
trigger higher valuations. One could even argue 
that investors now see insurers as a “value” play, 
with no surprises and no volatility, a view that 
removes growth and risk taking from the equation 
(with a corresponding impact on market multiples). 

Global insurers (those with a monoline presence 
in several countries as well as multiline in a few) 
thus face one pressing question: How should 
they revisit their business model and portfolio of 
activities to improve shareholder value creation? 
For global insurers, the question of where to play 
(and the related question of the “right to play” 
of several carriers) may well be an existential 
one: the next phase of the industry could deliver 
a structure in which insurance liabilities are 
reallocated toward their natural owners34—that is, 
the companies whose distinctive characteristics 
enable them to create more value in a given 
business than other potential owners could. In 

a worst-case scenario, global insurers could 
become irrelevant, with an industry slowly 
moving toward a structure in which retail P&C 
transfers to mutuals, bancassurance, and direct 
players; commercial P&C goes to reinsurers and 
specialists; life insurance goes to wealth, asset 
management, and private-equity firms; and health 
insurance becomes further entwined with public 
healthcare systems. Considering the role global 
insurers could play in addressing global issues 
such as climate and pandemic risks, maintaining 
their relevance becomes an urgent priority, for 
them and for society at large. 

Embracing a strategy of focus and local scale will 
require a hard look at global insurers’ portfolios 
of activities, as well as some tough decisions. We 
believe they can renew value creation by moving 
from a diversified, generalist, end-to-end business 
model toward a sharper, (multi)specialist business 
model. Many different flavors of focus will exist, 
all potentially sound bases for natural ownership: 
portfolios could be centered on a geography, a line 
of business (potentially through disposals and 
acquisitions), a distinctive value proposition along 
the value chain, or the differentiating advantages 
of private ownership. 

For leaders who find the prospect enticing and are 
excited to start such a transformation journey, we

their starting point and then testing their strategy 
against the following markers:

Geographical lens
1.  Aside from your home market, where do you 
have the position to achieve local scale and 
generate profitability above cost of capital, 
justifying investments?

2.  How should you tackle high-growth markets 

(such as Africa, emerging Asia, Latin 
America, and the Middle East) that might 
be the future of the industry but where you 
might have a subscale business? Is there 
an alternative path between divesting and 
scaling investments without end (for example, 
by spinning off the entity and keeping 
a minority stake)?

3.  Could you swap assets with other players 

in the same situation as yours to find a new 
equilibrium across multiple countries in 
one go?

Lines of business lens
4.  Taking a fine-grained approach to growth,35 in 
which lines of business should you focus your 
efforts and investments? How can you divest 
the ones where you cannot create value?

5.  Where you decide to compete, how can you 
promote innovation and cover new types 
of risks or client segments to increase your 
relevance in the market?

6.  Where you decide to compete, how can you 
develop adjacencies or new services (for 
example, generating tech-based revenues 
such as BlackRock earns from Aladdin, its risk 
management system)?

Value chain lens
7.  Are you the natural owner of the main 
building blocks of the insurance value 
chain (distribution, technology, 
administration, balance sheets and 
underwriting, investments)?

8.  Where you are not the natural owner, could 
you outsource part of your value chain 
to other players—even competitors—so 
that you can focus your investments on 
the distinctive elements of your value 
proposition (for example, Wakam and iptiQ 
acting as B2B2C providers without proprietary 
distribution networks)?

9.  Where you are the natural owner, could 

you insource activities from other players 
(for example, acting as a utility for other 
subscale insurers)?

COVID-19 has reset the playing field for the global 
insurance industry. To stake out a profitable, fast-
growing position, many companies will need to pull 
back on visions of global scale and instead find 
their key source of competitive advantage—one 
that makes them the best owner of their assets.
