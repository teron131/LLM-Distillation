Foreword

In a period of ongoing macroeconomic and 
geopolitical upheaval, the global payments 
ecosystem is once again demonstrating resilience. 
In the previous McKinsey Global Payments Report, 
we described an annual decline in revenues for 
2020, the first since 2009.¹  That decline, coming 
during the early stages of the pandemic, was less 
pronounced than anticipated.

The McKinsey 2022 Global Payments Report 
presents a detailed analysis of the 2021 results 
and the insights they reveal, including regional and 
country-level nuances. The report’s later chapters 
offer perspectives on areas where payments 
leaders’ actions will help determine market share 
shifts and the role of payments in the broader 
financial ecosystem.

At that time, we foresaw a nominal but 
geographically uneven rebound on the near-term 
horizon. As we describe in the lead chapter of this 
year’s report, actual results proved more robust: 
revenue growth in 2021 was 11 percent, the highest 
since 2017, leading to a record $2.1 trillion globally, 
and growth was healthy across all regions. Our five-
year revenue outlook now exceeds prepandemic 
expectations, topping $3 trillion by 2026.

As they often do, the drivers of growth are shifting, 
distributing gains in new ways and potentially to 
new and nontraditional participants. Inflation and 
interest rates are both reaching levels not seen for 
decades in many countries, altering consumer and 
business behavior and, consequently, payments 
dynamics. At the same time, capital market 
assessments of many fintech firms are undergoing 
recalibration—in some cases prompting companies 
to shift focus from pure growth to a profitability 
model.

The changes in the global landscape are creating 
new opportunities for incumbents and disruptors 
alike to win customers, develop new solutions, 
and claim market share. In short, the payments 
chessboard is being rearranged.

First, we examine a rapidly growing payments 
service: embedded finance, which involves the 
integration of a financial product into a broader 
customer journey. Brick-and-mortar versions have 
existed for decades in the form of auto loans at 
dealerships, sales financing at appliance retailers, 
and private-label credit cards at retail chains. 
Software companies are now partnering with 
banks and technology (or banking-as-a-service) 
providers to create similar seamless and convenient 
digital experiences. Leaders are already emerging 
in the race to provide banking infrastructure for 
embedded finance, and this chapter describes how 
incumbents and new entrants still have time to claim 
a share of this market.

We then turn to sustainability, which has become a 
topic of crucial importance for many corporations, 
including financial institutions. Sustainable global 
transaction banking remains in its early stages, 
but its potential for growth is estimated at 15 to 20 
percent annually for sustainable trade finance and 
cash management products. Research indicates 
that demand for such products far exceeds supply, 
with only 10 percent of demand currently being met. 
Few banks currently embed sustainability into their 
transaction banking offerings, so there is a clear

chance for leaders to capture a disproportionate 
share of the market. This chapter builds a 
case that banks should act now to create a 
sustainable payments value proposition.

In the next chapter, we take a fresh look at 
the early-stage development of central-bank 
digital currencies (CBDCs), which is occurring 
around the globe. Along with summarizing the 
various models under consideration, this chapter 
outlines the risks, opportunities, and potential 
paths forward for stakeholders and explains why 
we believe that the most promising scenarios 
involve public-private partnerships in which 
commercial banks play a material role.

In the final chapter, we examine how some of 
the fastest growth in digital payments over the 
past two years has been in emerging markets 
in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. In 

these areas, the pandemic accelerated shifts 
to contactless payments and e-commerce, and 
low banking penetration affords opportunities 
for payments providers to capture untapped 
potential and reach underserved populations. 
Competition among banks, fintechs, telecom 
companies, and retailers has intensified as 
e-wallets proliferate, instant bank transfers 
take off, and industry players form partnerships 
to access capabilities and broaden their 
customer base. We explore which digital 
payments models are best placed to gain 
momentum in emerging markets, which 
monetization paths payments providers are 
likely to pursue, and what innovations may lie on 
the horizon.

As always, we welcome the opportunity to 
discuss these essential payments topics with 
you in greater detail.

The global payments industry demonstrated 
its resilience again in 2021, more than recouping 
the revenue erosion experienced in 2020, which 
was the sector’s first decline since the 2008–09 
financial crisis. Our five-year revenue outlook 
now exceeds prepandemic expectations, topping 
$3 trillion by 2026. The factors fueling this 
expected growth have shifted in unexpected 
ways.

Payments industry revenues rebounded strongly 
in 2021, growing at an 11 percent rate—more 
robust than we forecast last year and reaching 
a new high of $2.1 trillion globally. Growth was 
strong across all regions, with both Asia–Pacific 
(APAC) and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa 
(EMEA) registering double-digit gains. Fee-
based revenue continues to increase at a faster 
rate than net interest income and comprises 
more than half of the total (although this trend 
may soon reverse, as we will discuss).

Looking forward, a confluence of events is 
reshaping the payments landscape. After more 

than a decade of low inflation and interest 
rates, many central banks—particularly in 
Europe and North America—have shifted 
their policies, leading to rapidly rising interest 
rates. Geopolitical factors, capital market 
resets, commerce expectations, technology 
advancements, and societal responsibilities 
are creating more pronounced sector 
and regional dynamics as well. This 
rapidly evolving landscape will create new 
opportunities for incumbents and disruptors 
alike to win customers, develop new solutions, 
and claim market share, reshaping the 
competitive chessboard.

A closer look at 2021
Payments revenues recovered rapidly from 
2020’s nominal contraction: Global revenue

recouping 2020’s pandemic-driven 5 percent 
decline but also registering a new high of $2.1 
trillion (Exhibit 1). Including 2021’s 11 percent 
increase, revenue growth over the past two

years has averaged 3 percent—below the long-term 
trend but well above the outcome feared by many.

Demonstrating the resilience of the payments 
industry, overall electronic payment transactions 
grew at a 19 percent rate in 2021—in line with 
prepandemic growth rates. Global e-commerce 
registered growth of roughly 17 percent, primarily 
driven by China, which now accounts for roughly 
half of global retail e-commerce sales.¹ The most 
dramatic COVID-19 impact can be seen in cash 
usage, which plummeted by 15 percent in 2020. As 
physical stores reopened in 2021, the cash rebound 
some expected did not materialize. The slight 1 
percent uptick in usage indicates that the vast 
majority of transactions that migrated to electronic 

channels in 2020 have remained electronic. Within 
the European Union, for instance, Greece and the 
Czech Republic had the sharpest reductions in cash 
usage from 2019 to 2021—15 percentage points and 
12 percentage points, respectively.

Revenue growth was strong across all regions in 
2021, surging to 13 percent in both Asia–Pacific and 
EMEA. The robust performance of Asia–Pacific, 
the largest regional revenue pool, accounted for 
57 percent of global revenue growth, and China 
accounted for 88 percent of Asia–Pacific’s growth, 
largely centered on account-to-account (A2A) 
activity (Exhibit 2). EMEA’s increase reflected more 
broad-based growth in electronic transactions.

still-robust 7 percent but were limited by credit card 
economic headwinds. Average US revolving card 
balances began to recover in the second half but 
ended 2021 with a decline relative to 2020, while 
net interest margins simultaneously contracted. US 
banks also struggled to deploy a surge in deposits 
driven by pandemic stimulus, leading to compressed 
net interest margins on transaction account 
balances. In Latin America, balances were flat in 
contrast to historically strong growth, and interest 
margins similarly tightened.

growth overturned expectations that 2020’s 
slowdown in card usage and ongoing pressure 
on interchange revenue was a sign of a longer-
term trend. However, debit cards have extended 
their lead as the most used card product, with 
94 transactions per capita globally, versus 49 
for credit. The share of debit card among overall 
electronic transactions is highest in Russia (84 
percent), followed by Norway, Ireland, and Romania 
(each roughly two-thirds).

A2A transaction revenues continued to increase 
their contribution in most geographies, in total 
accounting for roughly 29 percent of 2021’s rise 
in global revenue. The expansion of applications 
built on instant-payment use cases—such as bill 
payment, point of sale (POS), and e-commerce—
fueled the volume increase. Growth varies by 
country, with Hong Kong, Colombia, and Peru 
registering increases of roughly 50 percent and a 
tier of countries including Nigeria growing in the 
30–40 percent range. Many European countries 
continued to grow at rates well into double digits, 
even from well-established bases. In the US, growth 
rates for instant payments surpassed 60 percent, 
albeit off a relatively small base. At this stage of 
maturity, there remains room for a breakthrough 
that sparks an even higher US growth rate. In Asia, 
pricing was a bigger revenue factor than volume 
growth. In 2021, China rolled back much of the 
corporate rate concessions implemented during the 
pandemic; prices moved from approximately $0.79 
per transaction in 2019 to about $0.62 in 2020, 
returning to about $0.77 in 2021. Overall, we project 
global growth of instant payments to continue at 
double-digit rates, even faster than the healthy 10 
percent growth rates for cards over the past two 
years.

Debit and credit card transactions continued to 
grow at rates comparable to those before the 
pandemic (20 percent and 18 percent, respectively, 
between 2020 and 2021), as A2A growth mainly 
cannibalized cash and, to a lesser extent, checks, 
rather than card transactions. Credit cards’ volume 

There remains significant country-level dispersion 
in revenue per transaction, driven by a variety of 
factors, including transaction pricing dynamics 
and payment instrument mix (Exhibit 3). Our 
analysis of payments revenue per capita shows 
that this metric tends to be lower in developing 
economies, implying ongoing revenue opportunity 
as these countries’ payment systems continue to 
mature. In addition, global revenue per non-cash 
transaction has gradually declined—from $1.88 in 
2016 to $1.30 in 2021—as the pool of electronic 
transactions has grown faster than absolute 
revenue.

Global trade flows recovered in 2021, growing by 
27 percent and exceeding 2019’s prepandemic 
levels.²  Increasing commodity prices were the 
biggest factor, along with the release of pent-
up demand. Emerging markets generated the 
greatest trade flow increases in 2021, led by Africa 
(43 percent), Latin America (38 percent), and 
Asia–Pacific (26 percent), with developed markets 
growing in the 20 percent range. Following this 
rebound, however, we expect trade flow growth to 
slow to 1–2 percent annually through 2026 due to 
muted global economic forecasts. The developing 
global macroeconomic context might further 
reduce this expectation. For instance, geopolitical 
headwinds will reduce Eastern European flows by 
a projected 4 percent in 2022.

Our five-year revenue outlook anticipates average 
annual growth of 9 percent over the period—well 
above the historical long-term trend of 6 to 
7 percent. Much of the incremental gains are

fueled by interest-related income, a by-product of 
inflationary pressures and a rate environment many 
regions have not experienced for decades (Exhibit 
4). Although interest rates are notoriously difficult 
to forecast, we consider the payments sector to 
be well positioned to exceed the $3 trillion mark 
by 2026 or sooner. These macroeconomic factors 
are among several rearranging the chessboard and 
calling for a renewed strategic focus.

Looking ahead: Six forces reshaping 
the landscape
At a top-line level, our outlook for global payments 
through 2026 is remarkably favorable, with 
projected average annual revenue growth of 9 
percent. These gains will be distributed quite 
differently than in the past, however. Which players 
will capture the future revenues will depend on 
actions they take to capitalize on the opportunities 
created by six forces reshaping the landscape:

1. Macroeconomic environment. In many regions 
of the world, inflation is at its highest level in 
decades, potentially calling for changes in the 

business models of payments providers and other 
financial services firms alike. In this context, a 
central bank response to inflation may serve to 
expand interest margins, generating more income 
from this side of the payments equation, primarily 
for deposit-holding parties such as banks. The 
combination of inflation and interest margins, in 
turn, will require changes in the cash management 
strategies of businesses and consumers. At the 
same time, factors like the global energy and 
commodities environment create economic-
growth uncertainties and increase the likelihood of 
recession, differing by region. This, in turn, will have 
impact on the liquidity and investment strategies 
of many companies and households, altering 
payments economics on both the demand and 
supply sides. 

2. Geopolitical environment. Geopolitical 
disruptions are altering the long-standing 
trend toward globalization, prompting moves to 
greater payments regionalization and localization. 
Instances of regional and domestic networks 
with local control over key infrastructure are 
proliferating, challenging the standardization of

solutions across geographies. An increasing number 
of countries are looking to ensure local instances 
of payment services and key infrastructures, likely 
leading to increased complexity in local regulations 
and requirements.

3. Capital markets reset. While “attacker” 
payments companies significantly outperformed 
both the broader market and “incumbent” payments 
players over the last few years in the capital 
markets, 2022 saw a significant reset in valuations. 
In the 12 months ending August 2022, these 
same attackers delivered a negative 70 percent 
return to shareholders, compared to negative 
26 percent for incumbents. This valuation reset 
creates opportunities across the landscape as 
incumbent companies consider acquisitions and 
attackers focus on sustainable growth and a path to 
profitability. 

4. Commerce expectations. A main driver of the 
past high valuations of fintechs and attackers 
was the expectation of revenue growth through 
expanding customer relationships. This opportunity 
persists as payments increasingly serve an 
integrated, value-added commerce role rather than 
merely executing a stand-alone financial or money 
movement transaction. The most common current 
embodiment of this trend is commerce facilitation, 
extending beyond checkout and payment to 
enhance the commerce journey. The most promising 
for the future is embedded finance, or integrating 
finance products into nonfinance ecosystems. 
Players that can monetize services and data are 
poised to capture a larger share of revenue pools.

5. Technology modernization. After a long period 
of mostly incremental upgrades to networks, and 
to bank and business payment systems, companies 
are now making more structural as well as de novo 
infrastructure improvements. For instance, banks 
are aggressively modernizing their core systems 
to real-time, third-generation cores and updating 
their payments infrastructures, largely in response 
to the continued rise of instant payments, open-
banking requirements, and cloud technology. We 
forecast that several regions will enter the next 
S-curve on instant-payment transaction growth. In 
addition, with the continued growth of embedded 
finance, digital natives’ expectations for how 
those services are delivered will continue to exert 

pressure on providers to modernize their payments 
infrastructure. 

6. Social responsibility. The overall momentum 
for social responsibility in business—often 
characterized under the environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) banner—also is changing 
the context for payments. Governance covers 
the need for banks to act as gatekeepers against 
money laundering, fraud, and other unauthorized 
access to payment systems, and it is a major driver 
of investment and operational change across the 
industry. Inclusion and customer protection also are 
increasingly central to the missions of payments 
players.

In the following exploration of these six forces, we 
will assess their projected impact on payments 
revenue and offer ideas of how players across 
the ecosystem can adjust to and thrive in the new 
landscape.

The macroeconomic environment: 
Higher interest rates and inflation
Just as the primary drivers of payments revenue 
differ across the four major geographic regions, the 
impact of inflation and interest rates on revenue will 
vary geographically as well. In most regions, interest 
rate increases are expected, which will benefit 
markets more dependent on deposit balances, 
such as Europe and Asia. However, China, which 
accounts for roughly three-quarters of Asia–Pacific 
payments revenues, is reducing its interest rates as 
of this writing. 

Higher rates typically correlate with larger net 
interest margins on transaction account balances, 
which, in turn, generate liquidity-related revenue. 
These effects tend to materialize gradually, partly 
because of the rolling averages and maturity 
matching applied to calculate revenues. At the same 
time, offsetting effects may come from consumers 
and businesses shifting balances away from 
transaction accounts to other deposit vehicles in 
pursuit of higher rates—and from banks responding 
by paying higher rates to retain deposits. One 
example is the expected near-term elimination of 
negative interest rates on client deposits, which 
creates an immediate negative impact on bank 
revenues.

Inflation, in contrast, will create an organic 
uplift for the transactional components of 
payments revenue priced as a percentage of 
value, such as credit card interchange. Fixed 
transaction-based fee components might remain 
unchanged, potentially creating a drag on profits 
as related costs are rising under influence of 
the same inflation. Consequently, inflation could 
disproportionately hurt business models relying 
on per-transaction pricing (such as processing 
or most A2A services) while leaving volume-
based revenue models (like credit card merchant 
acquiring) unscathed.

Many current payments leaders have not yet 
navigated a high-interest-rate, high-inflation 
environment, and some emerging payment 
products and models—for example, buy now, pay 
later (BNPL)—are similarly untested under such 
conditions. Assuming the credit challenges of a 
potential downturn can be managed, traditional 
players like banks and card issuers could be well 
positioned for this macro environment, given that 
liquidity primarily accrues to account-holding 
institutions. Higher interest rates can partially 
soften profitability pressure on banks and may 
provide headroom to invest in strategic initiatives, 
such as payments and digital. However, an 
economic downturn, the potential for which varies 
by region, would alter this equation.

Geopolitical environment: Payments 
regionalization and localization 
Recent geopolitical events in 2022 have 
reinforced a growing trend of electronic payments 
infrastructure taking on heightened importance for 
national and regional governments. As discussed 
in prior Global Payments Reports, many countries 
have invested in modern instant-payment systems 
and are championing the use of these domestic 
schemes compared with nonnative alternatives. 
The focus is shifting to building applications and 
value-added services (such as functions that issue 
requests for payment) that leverage these rails to 
boost uptake and usage after sometimes-slow 
adoption starts.

In addition to instant payments, local networks 
are being established to reduce dependency 
on international providers or to support local 

policy agendas. Deployment of POS and online 
applications of local payment solutions, using 
economic models and access rules that differ 
from those of international solutions, allow 
countries to boost inclusion and grow local 
e-commerce—for example, Pix in Brazil, UPI in 
India.

A by-product of the focus on regional and 
national payments infrastructures will be the 
increased complexity of regulations across 
markets. Fragmentation and the need to localize 
will likely create continued disconnections across 
compliance and security requirements, despite 
ongoing international dialogue to standardize. 
This creates opportunities for payments providers 
that can simplify cross-border payments for 
customers or create turnkey solutions for related 
services—say, know your customer (KYC) as a 
service, digital ID, and security.

Geopolitical events and sanctions have also had 
an impact on trade and treasury international 
payments, strengthening regional bonds and 
creating shifts in segments and geo-corridors. 
The trend toward reshoring and nearshoring that 
emerged in 2020 continues to develop. What 
was initially believed to be a temporary strain on 
global supply chains has proven to be a persistent 
issue, with disruption affecting several sectors, 
including automotive and electronics. Ongoing 
logistic disruptions, elevated shipping costs, and 
stress on global supply chains are prompting 
initiatives to diversify suppliers and simplify 
shipping requirements. The trade corridor mix 
may shift as a result, although such transitions 
develop over years rather than months. For 
example, a number of the world’s largest tech 
manufacturers have recently shifted a significant 
share of their production of hardware peripherals 
and small electronic devices to different 
countries.

In this environment, banks active in the arenas 
of trade finance and supply chain finance need 
to consider how to reposition their strategies. As 
companies reconsider their supply chains, what 
is the best way to capture this reshoring trend? 
Which products and what differentiation can help 
maintain or increase relevance in a complex trade 
finance environment?

Capital markets reset: Turning 
unicorns into workhorses
Although payments companies’ return to 
shareholders has markedly exceeded that of 
financial institutions over the past decade, the 
story over the most recent year has been quite 
different. Many payments companies have 
been greatly affected by changes in investor 
expectations and macroeconomic conditions, 
as evidenced by an average 38 percent decline 
in total shareholder returns (TSR) in the 12 
months spanning August 2021 through August 
2022—significantly greater than the decreases 
experienced in the banking sector (10 percent), the 
overall market (13 percent), and among technology 
companies (26 percent). Market environment 
changes have had a particularly strong impact on 
attacker payments companies, which generated 
negative 70 percent TSR over the same 12 months 
(versus 26 percent for incumbent payments 
companies) and experienced sharp reductions in 

EBITDA multiples³: from approximately 80 times in 
August 2021 to 29 times in August 2022 (Exhibit 5).⁴ 

One cause of the change in valuations is a stark 
moderation in growth expectations: After attackers 
grew revenues 68 percent per year from 2019 
to 2021, consensus analyst growth estimates for 
2021 to 2023 have receded to 19 percent annually. 
Meanwhile, analysts expect the revenue growth 
rates of incumbent payments companies to remain 
relatively unchanged at 10 percent, compared with 
11 percent from 2019 to 2021. In essence, attacker 
firms relinquished the disproportionate shareholder 
returns realized since early 2020 and are now 
performing roughly on par with incumbent payments 
firms over a two-and-a-half-year horizon.

Within payments, some segments have shown 
greater resilience than others. In particular, 
“payments scheme” operators have felt the least 
impact from changes in investor expectations and

appetite, with a TSR decrease of 9 percent over the 
past 12 months and a relatively limited reduction in 
multiples, from 27 times EBITDA in August 2021 to 
21 times in August 2022. This could be due to the 
more balanced business models and strong market 
positioning enjoyed by traditional leaders in the 
sectors, which better insulates these companies 
from macroeconomic disruptions and changes in 
interest rates and inflation. In contrast, incumbent 
payments technology providers (for example, 
processors, merchant acquirers) fared worst of 
the subgroups, with a TSR decrease in 2022 of 44 
percent and EBITDA multiples decreasing from 32 
times in August 2021 to 15 times in August 2022, in 
response to radically revised growth expectations 
(26 percent for 2019–21, versus 11 percent for 
2021–23), notwithstanding their traditionally high 
margins.

This decrease in many payments companies’ 
valuations could provide a catalyst for consol-
idation by incumbent payments companies and 
tech company entrants, given the lower multiples 
and reduced feasibility of IPOs as an exit strategy 
for private firms. Attackers might, in turn, shift 
their strategic approach, moving from “growth at 
all costs” to a fundamentals-focused and cost-
conscious operating model with renewed focus on 
profitable customer and account growth, cash flow, 
and operating performance. These companies 
will likely revisit monetization opportunities—for 
example, partnerships with incumbent payments 
companies and companies in other sectors—
while maximizing the efficiency of their existing 
operating models. When the going gets tough, 
adept unicorns can quickly pivot into workhorse 
roles.

Commerce expectations: From 
payments to commerce facilitation 
High valuations for payments attackers were 
based in part on the promise of converting 
the frequency of customer touchpoints and 
engagement into monetization across both 
consumer and commercial customer journeys. 
This would require tapping into payments-
adjacent revenue pools such as marketing and 
personalization through payments data, commerce 
enablement optimizing the shopping journey 
beyond the payments experience, and software 

and services surrounding the payment. Such 
initiatives have been under way for several years.

The reset in valuations reflects, in part, a recognition 
that not all payments specialists will succeed in 
expanding their market reach beyond payments. 
Business models, such as neobanks employing 
debit and prepaid card products to acquire 
customers, will increasingly resemble traditional 
financial institutions if they cannot succeed in 
building customer ecosystems. Business models 
like small-business merchant services have proven 
more successful at creating platforms combining 
software and services that enable commerce for 
merchants. Our 2022 survey of US merchants 
shows the average spending on value-added 
services ranges from $11,306 for a small merchant 
to $112,067 for a large merchant, with the most 
common services for small merchants by spend 
including insurance, marketing, and customer 
relationship management (CRM).

Players in the landscape that can monetize services 
and data are poised to capture an outsize share of 
revenue pools. Nonbanks and technology players 
with a large captive audience are increasingly using 
embedded finance to enhance their role in the 
commerce experience, increase their engagement 
with end users, and gather additional customer 
data. Providers using embedded finance may 
continue to have the competitive edge, given the 
relationship with the customer and their larger 
ecosystem of services beyond financial services and 
payments. Extending into payments revenue pools 
may ultimately be easier than extending outside 
payments revenue pools. Meanwhile, opportunities 
are created for traditional financial services 
providers to provide the infrastructure enabling 
embedded finance, albeit without the customer 
relationship. 

Technology modernization: From 
incremental to structural
Payments providers have always required regular 
investments in infrastructure and systems 
technology. However, the high relative cost of 
changing complex and entrenched systems that 
have proven resilient has led many participants 
to limit investing to a long period of incremental 
improvements.

13

The chessboard rearranged: Rethinking the next moves in global payments 

This is changing. Payments infrastructures are 
now undergoing full redesigns, and banks are 
making fundamental adjustments to their core 
payment systems. According to McKinsey’s 2021 
Cloud Survey, the share of IT spending by banks on 
legacy infrastructure is expected to decrease from 
roughly 50 percent in 2021 to about 10 percent 
in 2024, thanks to private cloud and true multi-
cloud solutions. This step change in infrastructure 
modernization is a result of increasing pressure to 
support the transition to instant, open, integrated, 
and cloud-based solutions to meet continuously 
rising customer experience expectations across the 
commerce journey. 

Instant-payments volumes are increasing 40 to 60 
percent globally and showing signs of reaching an 
inflection point on the S-curve. Instant-payments 
usage continues to nearly double annually in India, 
Spain, and Thailand, among other countries, and 
it is increasing by roughly 50 percent per year in 
Australia and Singapore. Even in China and the 
United Kingdom, where the technology has already 
achieved broad adoption, growth continues at 
double-digit rates.

Continued open-data requirements from 
regulations (Europe) and market pressures (US) 
are forcing financial services providers to enable 
API-based access to payments data. Digital natives 
expect the benefits and efficiency of an API-based 
integration, so financial services providers that want 
to participate must create an orchestration layer on 
top of legacy systems. Retailers moving to the cloud 
are demanding payments networks and acquirers to 
support this shift with commensurate infrastructure 
upgrades of their own. Further, innovative 
infrastructure providers (for example, Cross River 
Bank and ClearBank) are delivering new capabilities 
through de novo payments infrastructures, raising 
the competitive bar even higher.

benefit while legacy providers grapple with the 
changing economics of their frontline business.

Meanwhile central banks and national payments 
communities are likely to continue to consider 
modernizing their national payments infrastructures 
even beyond instant payments for a range of reasons, 
including financial inclusion, global trade and 
competitiveness, and currency considerations. The 
exploration of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) 
will continue to progress, albeit at an evolutionary 
rather than revolutionary pace. 

Social responsibility: Heightened 
expectations
As noted in our Global Banking Annual Review 
of 2021,⁵ that year saw increasing pressure from 
governments, investors, regulators, and consumers 
to address climate risk and sustainability issues. The 
impact of ESG will extend to nonbank payments 
providers as well.

Environment will greatly influence the area of trade, 
where support to polluting commodities or industries 
comes under scrutiny. Relatively emission-heavy 
payments products, such as cash and checks, may 
face revision in the quest for carbon-neutral systems. 
At the same time, consumers are looking to their 
merchants and payments providers to understand 
the environmental impact of their purchases. 

Social responsibilities also affect payments, 
particularly given the role of payments in financial 
inclusion and data privacy. Digital payments and 
wallets in emerging markets have played a key role 
in bringing financial services to the underserved 
in cash-based economies. In developed markets, 
scrutiny of the role of payments in emerging verticals, 
such as gaming and cannabis, will likely continue in 
parallel with increasing consumer demand.

These forces are accelerating the potential 
decoupling of payments from the large legacy 
providers as payments increasingly shifts to 
outsourcing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
models. Providers that make the technology 
investments to offer payments as a service could 

On governance, payments companies play a key 
role, given their obligation to contribute to the 
stability, security, compliance, and resilience 
of economic systems. Investments required to 
support this gatekeeper role for the transactional

for instance—impose growing costs and 
challenges. Though historically more of a factor for 
international payments, the ESG role increasingly 
weighs on domestic providers of payment services 
as well.

We believe that over the next five years, ESG 
concerns will be at the core of strategies for 
payments providers, banks, and other firms in 
financial services and that these companies need 
to be clear about their efforts to meet consumer 
and business expectations. We explore examples 
of this further in our chapter on sustainable global 
transaction banking.

The payments industry is poised for significant 
growth over the coming five years; we expect an 
average annual revenue growth rate of 9 percent, 
exceeding the already-healthy prepandemic 
long-term trajectory of 6 to 7 percent. This 
growth will partly be in response to the changing 
interest rate environment, and partly to increasing 
dollar volumes resulting from inflation. In some 
regions, however, there is a greater chance that 
payments providers will face the headwinds of an 
economic contraction. Changes in the composition 
of revenue growth, along with other new sector 
dynamics, should prompt players across all regions 
and categories to revisit strategies and adjust 
courses of action.

The rare confluence of dynamics presents 
an opportunity for competitors to reposition 
themselves on the payments chessboard for long-
term advantage. For instance, players that can 
adapt their revenue and risk models and capabilities 
to macroeconomic factors like higher inflation 
and interest rates will emerge better positioned, 
protecting margins from higher operating costs 
while creating the right balance in revenue sources.

Incumbents may enjoy the balance sheet flexibility 
to make strategic acquisitions and significant 
technology modernization investments that position 
the company to capture future revenue pools. 
Conversely, attacker payments companies will 
need to adapt rapidly to new market realities. All 
players will need to reassess their business models 
and value propositions to capture opportunities 
emerging from payments regionalization, embedded 
finance, and the rising importance of sustainability.

The payments providers that adjust their operating 
models and platforms in a timely way to be both 
global and local will stand to benefit from the 
resulting scale and flexibility. They will also be 
well positioned to help customers navigate the 
growing complexity of the payments and commerce 
landscape, both cross-border and domestic. Those 
establishing early leadership in purpose, mission, 
and social impact will have the opportunity to win 
with consumers and mitigate reputational risk—and 
to monetize these value-added capabilities.

Embedded finance: Who will lead 
the next payments revolution?

Winners are already emerging in the race to provide banking and payments infrastructure 
for embedded finance, but incumbents and new entrants still have time to claim a share of 
this dynamic market.

Small businesses starting up today may never 
interact with a conventional bank. By logging into 
their e-commerce or accounting platform, they can 
open a deposit account, order a debit card, and 
meet most of their financing needs. The operators of 
these platforms are not usually banks. Rather, they 
are software companies that partner with banks and 
technology providers to embed financial products 
into a single seamless, convenient, and easy-to-use 
customer experience. This new form of partnership 
between banks, technology providers, and 
distributors of financial products via nonfinancial 
platforms underpins what has been hailed as 
the embedded-finance revolution. Sitting at the 
intersection of commerce, banking, and business 
services, payments has been one of the first use 
cases of embedded finance, and a large number of 
the aspiring embedded-finance providers originate 
from the payments industry.

The value of this integrated experience for 
customers helps explain why embedded finance 
reached $20 billion in revenues in the United States 
alone in 2021, according to McKinsey’s market-
sizing model.¹ According to our estimates, the 
market could double in size within the next three 
to five years. Despite the scale of this opportunity, 
many banks, payments providers, fintechs, 
investors, software firms, and potential distributors 
are unsure what embedded finance involves, how 
they can participate, and what it takes to win—
questions we address in this article.

What is embedded finance?
Put simply, embedded finance is the placing of 
a financial product in a nonfinancial customer 
experience, journey, or platform. In itself, that is 
nothing new. For decades, nonbanks have offered 
financial services via private-label credit cards 
at retail chains, supermarkets, and airlines. Other 
common forms of embedded finance include sales 
financing at appliance retailers and auto loans at 
dealerships. Arrangements like these operate as 

a channel for the banks behind them to reach end 
customers.

What makes the next generation of embedded 
finance so powerful is the integration of financial 
products into digital interfaces that users interact 
with daily. Possibilities are varied: customer loyalty 
apps, digital wallets, accounting software, and 
shopping-cart platforms, among others. For 
consumers and businesses using these interfaces, 
acquiring financial services becomes a natural 
extension of a nonfinancial experience such as 
shopping online, scheduling employees to work 
shifts, or managing inventory. This more deeply 
embedded form of embedded finance is what has 
grown so significantly in the US in recent years.

The evolution of embedded finance has been 
enabled by fundamental changes in commerce, 
merchant and consumer behavior, and technology. 
The digitization of commerce and business 
management has massively expanded opportunities 
to embed finance in nonfinancial customer 
experiences. As much as 33 percent of global card 
spending—50 percent in the US—now takes place 
online,  with a large portion of small and midsize 
companies in the US relying on software solutions 
for managing their business.³ In addition, as digital 
natives came of age, they expanded the pool of 
consumers and businesses open to receiving all 
their financial services via digital platforms. Finally, 
open-banking innovation, supported by mandates in 
the European Union and market-led adoption in the 
US, has helped unlock latent demand by enabling 
third-party fintech players to access consumers’ 
banking data and even conduct transactions on 
their behalf.

Who distributes embedded finance, 
and what products do they offer?
Embedded finance is likely to emerge in any 
environment in which a critical mass of end 
customers (consumers or businesses) have frequent

Embedded finance: Who will lead the next payments revolution?

(often daily) digital interactions with the operator 
of the digital platform, which we refer to as the 
“distributor” of embedded finance. For a nonbank 
company acting as a distributor, embedded finance 
offers a way to enhance the customer experience 
and create a new source of revenue without 
incurring the overhead associated with operating a 
bank. The types of businesses well placed to offer 
embedded finance include retailers, business-
software firms, online marketplaces, platforms, 
telecom companies, and original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs). All these categories have 
seen high levels of activity and innovation in 
embedded finance during the past year or two.

Among embedded-finance distributors and their 
end customers, demand is already maturing for a 
range of deposit, payment, issuing, and lending 
products (Exhibit 1). In addition to these traditional 

financial products, novel use cases are emerging. 
For example, embedded-finance distributors are 
offering prepaid cards to employees as part of 
earned-wage access programs; giving merchants 
the option to use their deposit accounts for instant-
payments settlement. Some are providing just-in-
time funded debit cards for gig economy workers 
to use when making purchases for members of 
delivery-service platforms.

The embedded-finance product portfolio is likely 
to expand further as customer-onboarding and 
product-servicing processes are gradually digitized 
and real-time risk analytics and services grow more 
sophisticated. Risk is likely to remain a constraint 
on growth, however, as products that require case-
by-case assessment, in-person touchpoints, or 
regulatory waiting periods, such as commercial real 
estate financing, are less susceptible to end-to-end

digitization. Despite these constraints, we estimate 
that products suitable for offering via embedded 
finance could account for as much as 50 percent of 
banking revenue pools.⁴ 

Who are the enablers of embedded 
finance?
The distributors of embedded finance rely on two 
sets of providers to manufacture the embedded-
finance offering and grant access to it (Exhibit 2):

 — Technology providers (fintechs) provide the 

platform through which distributors can access, 
customize, and offer embedded-finance 
products. Some, including Marqeta, provide 
point solutions for specific categories of 
financial products, such as card issuing. Others, 
including Unit, Bond, and Alviere, operate 
platforms that offer distributors multiple 
financial products, such as deposits, money 
movement, and lending.

 — Balance sheet providers (licensed or chartered 

financial institutions) are responsible for 
manufacturing embedded-finance products, 
providing risk and compliance services, and 
offering access to funds for lending and deposit 

products. Balance sheet providers sometimes 
partner directly with technology providers to 
create an integrated embedded-finance offering 
for distributors. For instance, Stripe is partnering 
with Goldman Sachs and other banks to offer 
embedded finance to platforms and third-party 
marketplaces.

A few banks and fintechs, including Cross River 
Bank and Banking Circle, fulfill both of these 
functions. Having built their own technology layer 
on top of their own balance sheet, they provide 
embedded finance to distributors such as retailers, 
business-software providers, marketplaces, and 
OEMs by themselves, with no need for additional 
partnerships.

Who is capturing the value?
Not all players benefit equally from the rise of 
embedded finance. As in banking in general, 
revenue primarily accrues to risk takers and to the 
distributors that own the customer relationship. 
For example, according to McKinsey research, 
the majority of revenues from embedded-finance 
lending products (55 percent of $14 billion in the 
United States in 2021) accrued to the balance 
sheet provider—the firm bearing the risk of credit

default. However, where payments and deposit 
products were concerned, the distributors who 
owned the end-customer relationship benefited 
most. In lending, for instance, they earned $4 billion 
of the remaining $6 billion revenue pool, equal to 30 
percent of total revenues.

These revenue dynamics explain two market trends 
we have observed. First, many embedded-finance 
distributors began by offering deposit and payment 
products before extending their product range to 
lending products such as credit cards and merchant 
financing. Deposit and payment products are 
attractive to distributors not only because they 
represent substantial revenue pools and promote 
stickiness, but also because they are a powerful 
tool for building customer relationships and 
capturing customer data that can be used to inform 
underwriting decisions for future higher-margin 
lending products. 

Second, many technology providers are seeking 
to capture a larger share of embedded-finance 
revenues by expanding across the value chain. In 
lending, for instance, they are looking to increase 
their share of revenues by finding ways to share in 
the risk, such as offering repurchase agreements for 
loans originated by balance sheet providers.

What does it take to win in embedded 
finance?
For embedded-finance providers, success demands 
clear differentiation in the form of product breadth 
or depth, or the provision of ancillary program 
management services. 

Options for differentiation
We see three main sources of differentiation for 
embedded-finance distributors, balance sheet 
providers, and technology providers:

1.  Product breadth. Many distributors are adopting 
a “land and expand” approach to embedded 
finance. They start by offering payment 
acceptance or deposits and then extend their 
product portfolio to lending products or more 

complex offerings to address customers’ 
broader financial needs. Some distributors 
prefer to shape their strategy around a one-stop 
shop developed with a single trusted technology 
partner that offers a wide array of products, 
while others opt to work with several technology 
providers to avoid overreliance on one partner.

2.  Product depth. A few technology and balance 
sheet providers are building deep expertise in 
specific embedded-finance categories such as 
issuing, in order to claim outsize market share 
in these niches. They develop innovative use 
cases—such as just-in-time fund deposits into 
cards or crypto-linked payment authorization—
as a basis for creating novel financial products 
for end customers. Over time, however, the 
demand for integrated financial solutions and 
the synergies that can be captured across 
product categories are likely to prompt these 
providers to protect their flanks with product 
breadth as well.

3.  Program management support. Many 

distributors that are new to embedded finance 
are understandably concerned about how to 
build, sell, and service a financial product for 
end customers. Some of them may see the 
regulatory and reputational risk attached to 
financial products, especially lending, as an 
insurmountable hurdle. To help them overcome 
the risk, many embedded-finance technology 
providers are offering sales, servicing, and risk 
management expertise or are orchestrating 
other partners providing them. The ability to 
provide distributors with this kind of program 
management is likely to be a key source of 
differentiation in the long run.

Key decisions for embedded-finance 
market entrants 
Although leaders are already emerging, the 
embedded-finance market still has ample white 
space for new entrants; we expect it to double in 
size over the next three to five years. The long-
term winners are likely to be those that are already

building the table stakes technology, expertise, 
and relationships needed for a future leadership 
position. Financial services firms and fintechs 
looking to stake their claims in the embedded-
finance business would be well advised to commit 
themselves to implementing four initiatives: 
choosing a strategy, establishing a developer 
experience, building capabilities to support 
distributors, and developing support and risk 
services.

Choose where to compete. For most banks with 
proprietary distribution, embedded finance 
represents a significant cannibalization risk. 
However, banks with limited footprints or localized 
relationships, such as community banks and 
regional banks, may see it as an attractive way 
to expand their revenue base. Some may be 
comfortable with growing deposits and earning 
revenues relatively passively, at least early on, but 
many will look for opportunities to differentiate 
themselves and boost revenues through more 
advanced products and support. At the moment, 
payments-focused technology providers are leading 
the charge on embedded finance, using their money 
movement capabilities to attract distributors and 
then expanding into products that have been the 
strongholds of banks, such as lending.

Build and enable a modern developer experience. 
Many banks and legacy financial services 
infrastructure firms are not yet equipped to 
externalize their processes and workflows to allow 
distributors to seamlessly integrate embedded-
finance products into their journeys or distribution 
platforms. Distributors wanting to scale up quickly 
will need to build a modern developer experience, 

including the necessary technology to enable it. To 
do this, they should provide third-party developers 
with self-service access and well-documented APIs. 

Adapt to B2B2C and B2B2B sales motions. 
Although some financial institutions operate with 
channel partners, many are accustomed to serving 
end customers directly. Those using direct channels 
will need to build a new set of capabilities to support 
distributors in selling embedded-finance products 
to their consumer or business customers.

Develop support and risk services. Retailers, 
manufacturers, telecoms, and other distributors of 
embedded finance may not have the capabilities 
to build, sell, and service financial products in a 
risk-controlled, regulatory-compliant, effective 
manner, nor will they have the time or appetite to 
build such capabilities. They will look to balance 
sheet and technology providers for advice on how 
best to deploy embedded finance and orchestrate 
the expertise and tools needed to deliver it in a 
compliant way. As well as providing advice, the 
balance sheet and technology providers will need to 
build a risk management framework that gives them 
confidence that the distributors they work with are 
acting within their risk appetite and in a compliant 
manner.

Winners are already emerging among the financial 
institutions that manufacture embedded finance. 
However, tech-savvy banks, fintechs, and payments 
companies that are willing to invest and partner still 
have time to claim their share of this fast-growing 
market.

Sustainability in global transaction 
banking: A market imperative

Sustainable financial products can propel revenue growth for banks and contribute  
substantially to businesses’ progress in meeting global climate goals. But success 
requires a strategic approach.

Sustainability¹ has become a topic of crucial 
importance for many corporations, including 
financial institutions. One reflection of this 
is the strong growth in sustainable debt 
instruments, which according to BloombergNEF 
surpassed $1.6 trillion in 2021.² In contrast, 
sustainable global transaction banking (GTB) 
is still in the early stages, but its potential for 
growth is significant. We estimate that revenue 
from sustainable trade finance and cash 
management products will grow by 15 to 20 
percent annually to total combined revenues of 
$28 billion to $35 billion in 2025,³ with market 
penetration reaching approximately 25 percent 
in trade finance products and 5 percent in cash 
management products.

Research also indicates that demand for 
sustainable GTB products far exceeds supply 
(at present, only 10 percent of demand is 
met⁴), and we expect that in the coming years, 
sustainability will become a vital element of 
a competitive GTB offering. Surprisingly, few 
banks today embed sustainability in their GTB 
products, handing market leaders an opening to 
capture a disproportionate share of the market. 
Banks should act now to build a sustainable 
GTB value proposition that enables them to 
defend existing relationships and expand their 
market share while staying ahead of customer 
demands and the expectations of employees, 
investors, and the public.

Sustainability in GTB: Opportunity 
and imperative 
Banks’ current sustainability offerings are 
typically incorporated in traditional lending 
products, and growth in these products 
has been remarkably strong. According to 
Bloomberg estimates, the combined volumes 
of sustainability-rated debt instruments have 
grown approximately 80 percent per year, 
increasing from approximately $155 billion in 
2017 to more than $1.6 trillion in 2021.⁵ 

By contrast, most banks across the world have 
taken only preliminary steps toward incorporating 
sustainability features within GTB products. This 
slow uptake derives in part from complexity—which 
arises from paper-intensive processes involving 
multiple parties—and from the lack of reliable data 
on companies’ sustainability-related activities and 
of industry standards for evaluating these activities.

Despite these challenges, embedding 
sustainability-tracking capabilities within core 
transaction banking services can be highly 
effective in improving companies’ performance on 
ESG metrics, as trade and payment transactions 
are systematic and recur frequently. What is 
more, trade finance rolls over frequently (every 
30 to 90 days), which means that products such 
as supply chain finance (SCF), letters of credit, 
and guarantees have the potential to contribute 
disproportionately to new volumes in sustainable 
finance.

The trade finance community—including financial 
institutions, export credit agencies, trade 
organizations, technology and service providers, 
and corporations—is focusing on various 
sustainability initiatives.⁶ Diverse banks offer 
sustainability-linked solutions, including deposit 
accounts backed by investments in sustainability-
rated assets and letters of credit issued for 
transactions in which the underlying asset (for 
example, batteries for electric vehicles) contributes 
to efforts to mitigate climate change. In addition, 
the number of requests for proposal (RFPs) for 
trade finance projects involving sustainability 
criteria is increasing, especially in the United States 
and Europe.⁷ 

The main reason for strong corporate demand 
for sustainable GTB products is that banks have 
unique access to transaction data (through various 
products like cash pooling and supply chain 
finance), which can be used to help companies 
manage the carbon impact of their operations 
and achieve their target contributions to industry 

1 Sustainability is a broad term covering the impacts of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) guidelines. Specifically, ESG guidelines encompass 
the degree of responsibility that companies assume, irrespective of what they are legally required to do, for sustainable development in these three areas.

sustainability goals, such as the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Banks can 
be particularly effective in assessing scope 3 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which typically 
account for most emissions linked to a company’s 
supply chain and are the most difficult to measure 
(see sidebar, “How to define sustainability for 
GTB products”). Stronger monitoring enables a 
company to reduce emissions along its supply 
chain, which enables it to meet the expectations 
of shareholders and stakeholders.

Not only do companies that adopt sustainability-
rated GTB offerings gain a stronger reputation 
in the eyes of investors and the public through 
a genuine and demonstrable commitment to 
better outcomes for the environment and society, 
they also typically gain access to favorable 
conditions from their own buyers, including 
dynamic discounting and wider access to credit 
from banks. At the next level, participation 
in an ecosystem supporting the shift toward 
sustainability enhances a corporate client’s 
access to suppliers with better sustainability 
performance on measurable outcomes. Further, 
stronger involvement of mid-corporates (which 
typically face significant challenges in complying 
with sustainability standards) helps to elevate the 

standards of the supplier base. Finally, improving 
performance on sustainability goals is part of a 
virtuous cycle: research shows that the financial 
performance of companies corresponds to how 
well they contend with ESG and other nonfinancial 
matters.⁸ 

Given the strong and growing demand among 
corporates for sustainable financial services, 
McKinsey estimates that in 2025, sustainable 
GTB global revenue pools will reach $16 billion 
to $20 billion in trade finance and $12 billion to 
$15 billion in cash management, both growing at 
an annual rate of approximately 15 to 20 percent. 
This opportunity entails primarily a shift from 
traditional GTB products to GTB products and 
services incorporating measurable sustainability 
objectives. Secondarily, it involves incremental 
revenues flowing from the anticipated acceleration 
of overall GTB revenue growth. Our projection 
of $28 billion to $35 billion in sustainable GTB 
revenue in 2025 represents 8 percent of global 
transaction banking revenue from core products, 
including trade finance (buyer-led, supplier-
side, and documentary) and cash management, 
including commercial cards, acquiring, POS, 
deposits, liquidity management, payments, and 
collections (Exhibit 1).

As evidence mounts that companies’ adoption of 
policies and practices to address sustainability 
is linked to stronger financial performance,⁹ GTB 
service providers stand in a unique position 
to support clients working toward combined 
sustainability and economic goals. And just as 
consideration of impacts on sustainability has 
become standard practice for a growing set of 
asset managers and institutional investors, we 
anticipate that sustainable GTB will become 
a market imperative and that the integration 
of sustainability-related features within core 
transaction banking services will become a vital 
element of a competitive offering.

that banks aiming to lead in this space should 
broaden their value proposition in three waves. 
First, they should enhance the basic products 
of trade finance and cash management with 
basic sustainability features. The next wave 
would involve building a more elaborate supply 
chain ecosystem with a robust sustainability 
rating methodology and advanced analytics 
to assess sustainability across the supply 
chain. Finally, depending on client needs 
and expectations in the markets served, 
banks could build advisory services to help 
corporate buyers and their suppliers improve 
their performance on sustainability goals.

ecosystem

in sustainable transaction banking, we believe

How to define sustainability for GTB products

Sustainable GTB products are cash management and trade finance products that support companies in their sustainability activities, 
which aim ultimately to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In the broadest sense, sustainability principles and practices enable organizations to assess their impacts on environmental, social, 
and governance matters while also considering their financial returns. More specifically, the 17 UN SDGs comprise 169 targets and 
231 indicators. Realizing the SDGs by 2030 will require an estimated $5 trillion to $7 trillion a year of new investment.¹ GTB, as the 
business responsible for moving these flows, has a critical role to play in achieving these goals.

Organizations’ internal sustainability frameworks and the UN SDGs complement each other by supporting businesses, governments, 
and civil society in their efforts to operate in ways that are genuinely sustainable in the impacts they have on the environment, society, 
and people. There are also important differences between these two components of sustainability governance. On the one hand, the 
sustainability frameworks of businesses focus on processes and are designed to report at a micro (firm) level, but they lack globally 
agreed-upon definitions and standards. On the other hand, the SDGs comprise both a specific set of time-bound goals and a globally 
accepted framework for reporting at a macro level (globally, regionally, or domestically).

At the intersection of companies’ sustainability frameworks and the UN SDGs stands the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP), which 
addresses the environmental component of sustainability, including UN SDG 13, which targets climate action. The GHGP, formed 
through a partnership between the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development,  
encompasses three scopes: the direct emissions from sources the company owns or controls (scope 1), indirect emissions from the 

1 Sustainability in export finance, ICC Global Export Finance Committee Sustainability Working Group, September 2021, iccwbo.org.

25

Sustainability in global transaction banking: A market imperative

generation of purchased energy (scope 2), and all other indirect emissions occurring as a consequence of the company’s activities but 
produced from sources not owned or controlled by the company (scope 3).²  GTB can contribute to improved performance in all three 
scopes, but it is in scope 3 where it has the potential to bring the greatest impact, particularly as it addresses 15 different upstream 
and downstream emissions, which can be monitored with the help of transaction data collected from across the supply chain.

Each link in the supply chain, from the underlying asset or good to transportation and the final use of funds or goods, affects the 
sustainability rating of a trade finance or cash management product (exhibit). For both product lines, the underlying asset—say, a wind 
farm, solar panels, electric vehicles, goods made from recycled materials, or an agricultural good produced with sustainable farming 
methods—is typically the main source of impact on external parties and, consequently, the most important factor in defining the value 
of the product as contributing to a company’s sustainability.

Note that while the GHGP categorizes greenhouse gas emissions associated with a company’s corporate carbon footprint (CCF) into 
scopes 1, 2, and 3, this categorization does not apply to the product carbon footprint (PCF). The PCF describes the total amount of 
greenhouse gas emissions generated by a product or a service over the different stages of its life cycle and is calculated according to 
various standards, such as ISO 14067 and PAS 2050. A sustainable GTB offering should take into consideration both corporate and 
product impacts.

Basic sustainable products 
The basic products of trade finance and cash 
management should incorporate sustainability 
features such as a basic rating methodology for 
qualified transactions:

 — Documentary trade finance. For sustainable 
buyers or sustainability-linked transactions, 
banks could offer documentary trade finance, 
including letters of credit or guarantees, at 
better pricing and improved access. As an 
illustration, a letter of credit for the delivery 
of solar panels would qualify as a sustainable 
transaction, offered at a preferred rate to the 
buyer—and transferable as a sustainable trade 
asset.

 — Cards. On commercial cards, banks could offer 
favorable terms for purchase of sustainable 
goods or a mechanism to compensate for high-
emission expenses such as travel. In addition, 
this category could include other products 
such as acquiring and point-of-sale (POS) 
products with features such as rounding up each 
transaction to divert the surplus to sustainability 
projects or lowering POS or e-commerce fees 
for purchases of sustainable goods or purchases 
from merchants with higher sustainability scores.

 — Account-related liquidity. Banks could invest 

deposits in sustainable assets.

 — Payments and liquidity management. In 

payments, banks could offer favorable terms 
on transactions for sustainable underlying 
assets and with counterparties scoring 
high on sustainability. In the area of liquidity 
management, banks could enable virtual 
accounts, which can be segregated from the 
account structure, to separate balances and 
transactions related exclusively to sustainable 
activities. Within collections, banks could 
offer favorable terms on digital collections 
and sell CO2 emissions credits to offset the 
environmental impact of cash and check 
transactions.

Some banks are already offering sustainable 
products. Examples from one bank include 
green guarantees and standby letters of credit, 
which guarantee an underlying project with 

a clear contribution to the environment. This 
solution focuses on five main sectors: renewable 
energy, clean transportation, waste management, 
sustainable water, and hydrogen. Another bank 
offers a sustainable deposit, which is dedicated to 
financing sustainable assets located in developing 
countries and is aligned with the UN SDGs. This 
offering—priced in US dollars, British pounds, and 
euros—is broader in scope than “green deposits,” 
available for several years, which focus on financing 
renewable-energy projects.

Supply chain ecosystems
A fully fledged sustainable supply chain ecosystem 
should enable suppliers and buyers to interact 
seamlessly, provide a robust sustainability rating 
methodology, and offer preferable rates to 
organizations that meet sustainability thresholds. 
The key strategic distinction of this wave is the use 
of advanced analytics to assess and manage ESG 
risk across the entire base of suppliers and buyers. 
For example, banks can help corporates assess 
the amount and types of GHG emissions that each 
supplier adds to total supply chain emissions and 
set policies for minimum standards and bidder 
exclusion criteria. The ratings capability (typically 
provided by a third party focused on sustainability 
assessment) is integrated within a technology 
platform that is usually supported by a trade fintech 
company.

Products in this wave include buyer-led and 
supplier-side trade finance:

 — Buyer-led trade finance. With buyer-led trade 
finance, such as reverse factoring, the bank 
could pay sustainable clients’ suppliers before 
maturity at a more favorable financing rate than 
in traditional reverse factoring. Or the bank could 
offer dynamic discounting, in which the buyer 
pays suppliers before maturity in exchange 
for a discount on the payable amount, with the 
discount rate decreasing as the supplier or 
underlying asset becomes more sustainable.

 — Supplier-side trade finance. Approaches to 

supplier-side trade finance could include invoice 
factoring where the invoice is discounted at 
a favorable rate for the supplier according to 
underlying sustainable assets or the involved 
companies’ ratings.

27

Sustainability in global transaction banking: A market imperative

For example, a global bank has developed a 
sustainable SCF platform, one of the main partners 
of which is a third-party sustainability ratings 
agency, affording participants greater transparency 
and objectivity than typically available with internal 
key performance indicators (KPIs). The platform 
also provides quantifiable, external evidence 
of participants’ ESG status in various areas, 
including the environment, human rights, labor, 
and sustainable procurement. The digital platform, 
developed in partnership with a fintech organization, 
includes market-tested capabilities for capturing, 
accessing, and onboarding suppliers. Fast 
integration of new suppliers reinforces supply chain 
resilience, which—along with enhanced visibility and 
communication on invoices—increases the value of 
the platform to all participants.

Another example is the launch of a sustainability-
linked reverse-factoring or SCF program in Asia–
Pacific to help corporate clients and their suppliers 
achieve their sustainability objectives and improve 
supply chain resilience, as well as manage working 
capital needs. The program includes criteria for 
periodic evaluation of suppliers’ performance 
in meeting ESG standards. ESG scorings are 
conducted by the corporate buyer’s independent 
assessor. Qualifying suppliers can access supply 
chain financing at preferential rates tied to their 
sustainability score.

Advisory and certification services
Advisory and certification services can support 
companies in their ongoing efforts to reduce 
GHG emissions along their value chain. These 
value-enhancing services, which are adjacent 
to sustainable GTB products and platforms, 
extend beyond the traditional core competency 
of transaction banking. By consulting on various 
marketwide standards and assisting clients in 
achieving ESG certifications and improving their 
ratings, banks can reinforce the trusted advisory 
role that any GTB institution claims to pursue 
and can gain a distinct competitive advantage. 
Banks may also consider providing an ecosystem 
of nonfinancial sustainable offerings, including 
mobility- and energy-related products.

Significantly, banks have the potential to 
provide comprehensive and holistic advisory on 
sustainability performance metrics by leveraging 
their extensive data sets. As an example, a bank 
might advise a corporate on reducing emissions 
along its supply chain or provide support in 
establishing baseline emissions of the company’s 
suppliers or projects. It might also consult on using 
aids for sustainability that are available to the 
public at no charge, such as sustainable metrics 
in procurement selection, and on benchmarking 
with other banks or companies to raise targets and 
improve monitoring. In addition, banks can work with 
suppliers to reduce emissions linked to materials 
and processes. Further, they might prioritize 
personal engagement with small and medium-size 
enterprises (SMEs) to expand the reach of their 
advisory business, as smaller firms are typically 
underserved by rating agencies, which, due to their 
limited sales networks, tend to focus on large firms.

Banks can also support certification on emissions 
by standardizing the process for obtaining broadly 
recognized assessments of each supply chain 
participant’s performance on environmental 
sustainability measures. This service would include 
the identification of environmental-sustainability 
KPIs, customized by industry and subsector, and 
the selection of thresholds for varying levels 
of compliance with GHG emissions standards. 
Leveraging their unique access to data along the 
value chain, banks can establish automated tracking 
systems to evaluate suppliers’ performance on 
select KPIs.

Based on our examination of 12 banks, we have 
observed that sustainable GTB offerings vary 
according to bank size and markets served. For 
instance, global banks offer the broadest range 
of sustainability-linked trade finance and cash 
management products, including advanced 
digital platforms through which corporates and 
qualified suppliers may access SCF at preferential 
rates (Exhibit 2). However, few of these platforms 
operate at scale. The sustainability offering of 
banks operating in two or more global regions 
(multiregional banks) is typically limited to the

incorporation of basic sustainability features into 
trade finance products, with the majority also 
partnering with independent rating agencies to 
score suppliers on the extent of their sustainable 
practices. Few multiregional banks offer an 
advanced digital platform. Domestic banks 
generally focus their sustainability program on 
lending and currently do not offer GTB products 
with sustainability features. 

Across banking segments, sustainable 
advisory and certification services are limited 
or nonexistent. Advanced digital platforms 
provide an excellent environment for scaling 
these adjacent services, which have the potential 
to contribute significantly to GTB revenue. At 

present, however, sustainability advisory represents 
white space to be explored.

Constraints to scale
With so many untapped opportunities, what 
is holding back banks? We see three types of 
constraints limiting their ability to scale sustainable 
GTB products:

1. 

lack of standards on several levels 

2. 

limited capital available for ecosystem 
development and operation 

3.  an economically challenging business model 

29

Sustainability in global transaction banking: A market imperative

Lack of standards on several levels
As discussed in a McKinsey report prepared 
last year in collaboration with the International 
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and Fung Business 
Intelligence,¹0 diverse standards vital to creating 
an efficient, transparent, and wholly interoperable 
global system of trade finance are in varying 
stages of conceptualization, development, and 
implementation. Gaps in the development and 
application of standards pose challenges on 
several levels, from trade documentation to product 
definitions, data models, application programming 
interfaces (APIs), and shared utilities:

 — Standards for sustainable digital trade 

documents. While numerous efforts have 
attempted to make electronic documents legally 
acceptable and some countries have adopted 
the Model Law on Electronic Transferable 
Records (MLETR), more effort is required to 
increase adoption by making the law more 
broadly acceptable and introducing electronic 
transferable records for sustainable trade.

 — Standard definitions of sustainable trade 

finance products. There are disparate efforts 
to establish a widely accepted trade finance 
product taxonomy, such as that published 
by the Global Supply Chain Finance Forum.¹¹  
However, the global trade finance community 
still lacks common definitions of “supply chain 
sustainability” (broadly) and “sustainable trade 
finance products” (more narrowly).

Adoption of standards governing the design of 
APIs for trade finance systems has been limited, 
however, and the proliferation of proprietary 
models increases the fragmentation of the 
global trade finance ecosystem. Banks continue 
to publish proprietary B2B APIs, just as fintechs 
design data models for interaction with their own 
platforms.

 — Standards for shared utilities. As an example 
of industry efforts to establish standards for 
shared utilities, SWIFT announced last year 
that its KYC Registry would be the first global 
utility to integrate the ICC’s Sustainable Trade 
Finance Guidelines for customer due diligence, 
which cover key areas such as sustainability 
commitments, capacity and track record, supply 
chain practices, and commodities.¹² 

Limited capital for ecosystem development and 
operation
The capital available for investment is limited, which 
for banks and corporates alike poses a significant 
challenge to the implementation of a sustainable 
GTB offering. Further, a substantial investment is 
required to build the data platforms critical for the 
advanced sustainability products and services of 
the second and third waves (that is, a GTB digital 
ecosystem and advisory and certification services). 
As fintech valuations have dropped significantly 
this year, technology providers are facing new 
constraints in accessing capital, which may hamper 
development of more robust platforms.

 — Standards for uniform sustainable trade finance 

data models. Sharing information among 
participants is at the center of a sustainable 
ecosystem. A data model might, for example, 
govern how a specific sustainable product 
or company sustainability rating should be 
presented and which technical format should be 
used.

 — Standards for sustainable trade finance APIs. 
Standard APIs would enable participants to 
connect and exchange data seamlessly with 
multiple networks and service providers. 

Additional investments are needed to establish and 
run partnerships with the various parties involved in 
the trade finance ecosystem—for example, fintech 
companies, ratings agencies, shipping and logistics 
companies, banks, and technology companies. 
These arrangements can carry hidden costs that are 
often overlooked. Banks may also need to consider 
the potential opportunity costs that come with 
partnerships: the decision to enter a partnership 
instead of developing a capability in-house usually 
closes the door on other opportunities. Furthermore, 
the cost to unwind a partnership can be significant, 
should it not live up to expectations.

An economically challenging business model
The third major constraint is the economic challenge 
of scaling an offering that relies largely on discounted 
pricing for sustainable companies. What is more, the 
gap between trade finance supply and demand has 
reached $1.7 trillion, with rejection rates for SMEs 
running at 40 percent.¹³ Banks should consider how 
much funding can be designated for sustainable 
finance products in order to meet clients’ needs and 
realize trade finance’s potential contribution to the 
UN SDGs.

One way to address this constraint would be an 
asset-light model, where the bank creates a class of 
sustainable trade finance assets for large investors. 
This originate-to-distribute model creates capacity 
for banks to issue further credit and offers investors 
several advantages, typically including low default 
rates, short-term durations, and self-liquidation.¹⁴ 
To succeed, this approach should be accompanied 
by continual improvements in digitization and 
standardization to offer investors more transparency.

principles and goals within their business 
line strategy in alignment with the bank’s 
broader sustainability strategy. This strategic 
vision should also broadly identify the sectors 
expected to benefit the most from the bank’s 
sustainable GTB offering. 

The next step is to identify the priority products 
and criteria for sustainability ratings, bearing 
in mind that these constitute the core value 
added for clients from diverse industries and 
segments. Leaders should start by stating 
clearly which elements of ESG the sustainable 
GTB offering will cover and then—in many cases, 
in partnership with an ESG-ratings company—
develop metrics for assessing performance 
to discrete objectives. These metrics can be 
applied, on the one hand, to the evaluation of 
financial instruments or products to be offered 
to clients and, on the other, to the establishment 
of sustainability ratings for SCF platform 
participants.

Next steps: How to build a sustainability 
value proposition 
Banks differ in how far along they are in developing a 
sustainability value proposition for GTB. While several 
have incorporated sustainability elements in select 
cash management and trade finance offerings, many 
lack a clear sustainability strategy for the enterprise. 
Others have launched solutions to match their 
competitors or in response to a client request, but 
these initiatives are often launched without assessing 
the potential impact of offering the solution to other 
clients.

Choose the appropriate sustainability strategy
Across global markets, any GTB service provider must 
consider the expectations of customers, investors, 
regulators, and the public and think holistically about 
how to add value to corporate and SME relationships 
with a sustainable GTB offering. Based on their 
starting point, banks should consider the following 
elements for implementing the sustainability strategy:

 — Banks with basic sustainable GTB products 
should complete their offering by extending 
beyond trade finance products to enhance 
traditional cash management products—for 
example, deposits, commercial cards, and 
acquiring—with sustainability features. These 
banks will also need to build partnerships, as 
sustainability is part of an ecosystem where 
different organizations fulfill distinct roles, such 
as maintaining the technology platform, enabling 
sustainability-linked transactions, administering 
sustainability ratings, and managing data assets 
to ensure consistent execution and transparency. 
Selecting partners can be an arduous journey, 
encompassing identification and evaluation 
of potential partners and implementation and 
integration with the platform. Several cross-
industry groups are developing services to 
leverage transaction data to reduce carbon 
emissions. Banks can partner with fintech 
or open-banking platforms to access open-
banking data.

 — Banks without any sustainable GTB offering 
should start by embedding sustainability 

 — Banks with a leading offering should focus on 
building value-added services in sustainability

which could help to differentiate a bank’s 
sustainability offering. Advisory services could 
provide deep knowledge on regulations and 
insight into the implications of sustainable 
GTB and sustainability ratings across diverse 
industries. Certification should provide 
legitimacy and consistency in the increasingly 
complex population of sustainability rating 
agencies, and banks should be able to provide 
KPIs and tracking mechanisms to monitor 
corporate clients and their suppliers and 
customers. Finally, analytics should provide a 
rigorous framework to guide clients’ and banks’ 
decisions about how to maximize the impact 
of the actions taken to reduce emissions. This 
capability could be developed in-house or in 
partnership with specialized data analytics 
providers.

and accelerate the adoption of the sustainability 
offering by engaging effectively with clients 
in target sectors, using automated monitoring 
and feedback loops to improve messaging. It 
will also be crucial to train sales specialists for 
sustainability-linked products, as well as educate 
colleagues about the bank’s overall position on 
ESG principles and what the new sustainable GTP 
offering can do for clients (and for society)—all 
supported by a robust digital engagement and 
communication strategy. Internal communication 
across the bank should be continuous, fast, and 
consistent. Sharing success stories, including 
public recognition of clients who achieve new 
levels of certification, also can strengthen 
engagement with both clients and colleagues. 

Go to market and then accelerate
Banks should define a go-to-market strategy for 
sustainable GTB, prioritizing sectors that have 
higher overall emissions and are more relevant 
to the institution’s business. Examples of priority 
sectors might include energy, retail and luxury, and 
automotive and industrials. By targeting industries 
with higher scope 3 emissions, banks have greater 
potential to deliver a significant improvement in 
the sustainability performance of corporate clients 
and their suppliers.

Once a bank has launched any offering, it is 
important from the beginning for it to promote 

Sustainability in GTB represents a significant 
opportunity for banks not only to meet their 
ESG objectives but also to expand revenue as 
they help customers meet their business and 
ESG needs. Moreover, the transaction banking 
business, through which different flows converge, 
has the potential to deliver an outsize impact on 
the reduction of societies’ GHG emissions by 
serving as a channel to deliver tools for improving 
sustainable practices at client organizations 
in diverse industries around the globe. For all 
these reasons, success at sustainable GTB is an 
imperative; achieving it depends on implementing 
a comprehensive and coherent strategy.

Central bank digital currencies: 
An active role for commercial 
banks

With central banks increasingly exploring central bank digital currencies 
(CBDCs), now is the time for commercial banks to establish their role in a 
fast-changing landscape.

by Olivier Denecker, Arnaud d’Estienne, Pierre-Matthieu Gompertz , and Elia Sasia

Roughly 90 percent of the world’s central banks 
are pursuing central bank digital currency (CBDC) 
projects.¹ Some, including those in the United States 
and South Africa, are at the exploratory phase; 
others are development projects (the European 
Union) and pilots (China). In some locations, 
including Nigeria and the Bahamas, solutions are 
already operable, and central banks are looking 
to expand. Despite the high level of activity, most 
CBDC initiatives today remain in the nascent 
stages of market development and, in many cases, 
even technical design. However, alongside the 
conceptually similar but quite distinct digital coins 
being issued by private entities, this form of digitally 
issued public money stands at the forefront of 
central bank innovation in the monetary space.

In particular, four trends have likely spurred central 
bankers’ interest in CBDCs: 

1.  Cash usage has rapidly declined—by roughly 
one-third in Europe between 2014 and 2021, 
dropping to as low as 3 percent (in Norway) 
of overall payment transactions. This trend 
threatens to marginalize the sole source of 
central bank or public money in many economies, 
requiring central banks to reassess their role in 
the monetary system.

2.  Growing interest in privately issued digital 
assets signals potential competition with 
central banks in their role as the sole provider 
of monetary value in sovereign economies. 
Various recent sources show a meaningful share 
of consumers worldwide actively involved in 
trading, transacting, or holding digital assets, 
with particularly high rates in emerging markets. 
For example, 10 percent of UK adults reported 
holding, or having held, a crypto asset.² The 
European Central Bank (ECB) has indicated 
that as many as 10 percent of households in six 
large EU countries owned digital assets.³ And 
roughly one-fifth of respondents to a McKinsey 
survey—22 percent in India, 20 percent in 

Brazil, and 14 percent in the US—reported that 
they held digital assets as part of their financial 
portfolios.⁴ Some see consumer use of digital 
assets as a potential challenge to fiat currency 
as a unit of measurement for transactions and 
value.

3.  Some central banks perceive erosion in their 

role as payments innovators—thought leaders 
advancing next-generation models beyond 
today’s cash and infrastructure. CBDCs offer the 
potential to improve on legacy cash use cases, 
such as by reducing cross-border transaction 
costs and enhancing financial inclusion. By 
spearheading the design process and clarifying 
use cases, central banks can ensure that these 
strategic conversations take place in a public 
forum.

4.  Many central banks are looking to establish 
greater local governance over increasingly 
global payment systems. As the appointed 
guardians of systemic stability, central banks 
see potential benefits of establishing a CBDC as 
the anchor of local digital payment systems. 

While most CBDC initiatives are nascent, 
commercial bank leaders would be well advised 
to engage central banks in order to learn more 
about these digital initiatives and help shape 
future models. Along with summarizing the 
various models under consideration, this paper 
outlines the risks, opportunities, and potential 
paths forward for various stakeholders.

A central bank solution with many 
permutations 
CBDCs differ fundamentally from other forms of 
digital coins in that they are directly backed by 
central bank deposits or a government pledge. 
Therefore, they offer stable value and can aim to 
combine benefits in the areas of trust, regulatory 
stability, and audit transparency.⁵

Central bank digital currencies: An active role for commercial banks

 
CBDCs can be deployed under a variety of 
technology models, depending on a central bank’s 
desired objectives and use cases. CBDCs do not 
necessarily rely on decentralized technologies, as 
they can be administered by central bank agents as 
well as distributed via digital-ledger technologies. 
They can be held on physical devices such as cards 
or phone wallets or exist as a purely digital book 
entry. They can be issued as stand-alone tokens 
(stored at any of multiple carriers) or as account-
based assets held directly at the central bank.

A fundamental decision for central banks is 
whether to issue a retail or wholesale CBDC. 
Each has its own set of objectives, use cases, 
and end users. Wholesale CBDCs mostly target 
financial institutions (banks and nonbanks) and 
large corporate treasury centers as their primary 
users, and they aim to improve the efficiency 
of settlements—both payments and securities, 
domestic and cross-border. This may or may not 
involve providing nonbanks with direct access to 
central-bank accounts.

Cross-border settlements may be a particularly 
compelling use case for wholesale CBDCs, given the 
high cost and slow execution of current processes 
and the opportunity to reduce counterparty risk by 
enabling connected and instant settlement between 
parties. For example, Project Aber, launched by 
the central banks of Saudi Arabia and United Arab 
Emirates, tested the use of a jointly issued digital 
currency as an instrument for domestic and cross-
border settlement between the two countries. 
For wholesale CBDCs, the use of new and often 
“distributed” technologies is frequently central to 
the exercise, a potential means to expand access to 
public money.

Retail CBDCs target consumers and local 
businesses as end users, with possible use cases 
including disbursement of social benefits, an 
alternative to cash for e-commerce point-of-service 
and bill payments, and enabling of seamless peer-
to-peer transactions for banked and unbanked 
users. In more complex initiatives, CBDCs combined 

with smart contracts,⁶ such as the Bank of Israel’s 
initiative, aim to improve payments convenience. 
Examples include payment of sales tax directly 
to tax authorities at point of sale and automated 
distribution of social benefits for economic relief 
conditioned on the recipients meeting defined 
requirements.

A growing central bank imperative 
Although central banks quote numerous reasons 
to pursue CBDC projects, surprisingly few such 
projects appear to be driven by specific customer 
use cases or needs. Notably, the case for CBDCs to 
date has been focused more on policy and systemic 
objectives than by specific customer requirements 
or benefits. CBDCs could enable central banks 
to address a wide range of systemic objectives—
ensuring financial inclusion, reducing fraud 
and money laundering, guaranteeing sovereign 
alternatives for digital payments, stimulating local 
payments innovation, and creating a new vehicle for 
monetary policy. The objectives central banks have 
identified in their pursuit of CBDCs at this stage 
typically fall into one or more of five categories. 

Developing ‘cash 2.0’
Central banks are under pressure to deliver a next-
generation payments vehicle providing several of 
the features that users value about cash: ubiquity, 
universal acceptance, and anonymity. Also, in both 
emerging markets and developed economies, 
reduced cash usage and rising digitization of 
financial services have heightened financial 
inclusion challenges.

CBDCs could equip central banks to play a direct 
role in facilitating financial services access for 
the unbanked who are reluctant to connect to 
commercial banks or in some cases may be 
overlooked because they lack sufficient revenue 
potential. CBDCs could also enable accounts to 
be held directly on the central bank ledger, with 
account holders accessing and transacting with 
their balances through digital wallet applications 
linked to the central-bank account through APIs.

6 Contracts that can be self-executing and self-enforcing, without the need for intermediaries.

35

Securing the monetary anchor
The reduction of cash and the advent of alternative 
payment currencies have threatened the role 
of public money (as opposed to commercial 
bank money) as the fundamental unit of value 
measurement. An increasing share of commerce 
is poised to be conducted through alternative 
payment means that lie outside the bounds of 
regulatory control. CBDCs could help preserve 
the role of public fiat in monetary policy, securing 
central banks’ role in protecting financial stability on 
their markets.⁷ 

Preserving central banks’ role in orchestrating 
payments services innovation
With the growth of nonbank players in payments, 
central banks face potential erosion of their 
oversight role in important areas such as data 
management, settlement systems, and customer 
rights—areas they have historically supervised 
through traditional licensed banks. Central banks 
have also struggled to achieve efficiencies in areas 
such as cross-border payments.

A CBDC alternative would allow more direct control 
and influence over enforcement of minimal market 
standards. Privacy issues would need to be carefully 
managed, however, given the (real or perceived) 
access to detailed transaction data afforded to 
government entities through a CBDC.

Keeping pace with international currency 
advances
To ensure the preeminence of their currency zone—a 
core central bank objective—central banks must 
keep pace with their international currency peers. 
Most also aim to maintain at least one scalable 
solution for economic value exchange beyond the 
control of other countries or central banks. CBDCs 
are one of the potential policy vehicles in this cross-
border competition.

Stimulating financial inclusion
CBDCs can play a key role in providing access to 
digital payments without the requirement of a bank 
account. Access would be facilitated by a central 
bank–issued digital wallet. The Nigerian and 

Jamaican CBDC models (see sidebar, “Country 
case studies”) offer a template for how this could 
be accomplished.

Potential for radical redesign
Ultimately, the success of CBDC launches will 
be measured by user adoption, which in turn 
will be tied to the digital coins’ acceptance as 
a payment method with a value proposition 
that improves on existing alternatives. If such 
benefits remain unproven, CBDC efforts may fall 
short of adoption targets. In this scenario, the 
ramifications for traditional banking and payments 
players will be limited. However, should initiatives 
progress beyond the pilot stage, central banks 
and governments are likely to deploy all tools at 
their disposal to foster success, given the critical 
policy objectives just outlined, as well as potential 
affect on central bank credibility. To be successful, 
CBDCs will need to gain substantial usage, 
partially displacing other instruments of payment 
and value storage.

The successful launch of a CBDC involving direct 
consumer and business accounts could displace 
a material share of deposits currently held in 
commercial bank accounts and could create a new 
competitive front for payment solution providers. 
Bankers are already facing the need to strengthen 
their client relationships beyond the traditional 
deposit model; CBDCs could exacerbate this 
challenge.

Commercial banks will likely play a key role in 
large-scale CBDC rollouts, given their capabilities 
and knowledge of customer needs and habits. 
Commercial banks have the deepest capabilities 
in client onboarding (including know your 
customer) and the execution and recording of 
transactions, so it seems likely that the success 
of a CBDC model will depend on a public–private 
partnership (PPP) between commercial and 
central banks, or at minimum a less formal 
collaborative model that promotes a digitized 
monetary environment across the banking and 
payment value chain.

Central bank digital currencies: An active role for commercial banks

Country case studies

Some countries’ central banks have already tested CBDC concepts. The experiences of Nigeria, China, and Jamaica suggest lessons that may 
apply in other parts of the world.

Nigeria’s eNaira
Nigeria became the first African country to introduce a digital currency with the October 2021 launch of retail CBDC eNaira. Its intended bene-
fits include faster and more equitable distribution of cash assistance to households and communities participating in social welfare programs, 
lower transaction costs and faster settlement, efficient cross-border transaction capabilities, and traceability and security to limit fraud.

The eNaira app garnered almost 800,000 downloads in the first seven months following its launch. According to some reports, half of those 
downloads have not been activated. Merchant adoption of digital currency has been similarly limited, with fewer than 100 active retailers  
accepting eNaira payments as of May 2022—a small number, given Nigeria’s status as Africa’s largest economy.

The low initial uptake of eNaira has been attributed to limited knowledge of the CBDC and how it functions, fear of exposure to security  
breaches, and poor internet access in some regions. In response to these challenges, the Nigerian government recently announced that  
eNaira will be made available on feature phones via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which will expand the potential market 
by 100 million citizens on top of the current 25 million to 40 million smartphone holders.¹ The government also recently sponsored a hackathon 
to promote visibility and identify key feature and technology improvements.

China’s digital yuan
The People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank, in 2019 began a large-scale pilot of its E-CNY, spanning 15 cities. As of May 2022, 4.5 million 
merchant wallets and 260 million transactions worth over 83 billion renminbi have been performed through the E-CNY pilot, focused on trans-
portation, government services, shopping, and other consumer-lifestyle use cases.

Considering China’s relatively high penetration of electronic consumer payments, a fully implemented E-CNY could address the last mile in 
transitioning China to a fully electronic and real-time payment system. Internationally, E-CNY could provide an alternative for global trade  
settlement, which remains highly reliant on US dollars and the SWIFT network.

E-CNY employs a hybrid design model, which is account based on the wholesale layer and token based at the retail level. According to 
published documents, state-owned banks, commercial banks, and payments networks will all play operating roles, with both individual and 
merchant wallets being created and maintained by commercial banks.

Although the pilot has encompassed significantly more volume than any other country’s CBDC initiative, it remains a small fraction of China’s 
overall payments activity. An official time for a formal E-CNY launch has yet to be announced; a high-profile pilot expansion to the 2022 Beijing 
Summer Olympics was muted by the exclusion of spectators.

Meanwhile, pilot testing is being extended to cross-border payments. For instance, pilot testing of cross-border payments between Mainland 
China and Hong Kong—which has a separate legal and banking environment and infrastructure—is under way. The pilot involves 200 employ-
ees and selected merchant clients of the Bank of China (Hong Kong), a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China and Hong Kong’s sec-
ond-largest commercial bank.

Jamaica’s Jam-Dex
Jam-Dex, which launched in June 2022 and is the first CBDC to be formally ratified as legal tender, is a relatively simple retail offering with 
“streamlined” KYC requirements and, in its initial iteration, no advanced use cases such as cross-border payments or smart contracts. Although 
Jam-Dex leverages distributed technology, it is not blockchain based, setting it apart from the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar and the Eastern Caribbe-
an Central Bank’s DCash. 

The Jamaican Central Bank is pursuing an indirect model, collaborating with the private sector for interfaces and issuance of digital wallets 
while directly managing the back end, infrastructure, and ledger. The goal is to offer a digital alternative to cash that is seamless, secure, and 
simple to use. Early Jam-Dex use cases emphasize peer-to-peer payments and payments to small and micro-businesses, including those 
without traditional bank accounts, enhancing financial inclusion.

However, depending on a central bank’s design 
choices—and there is a multitude of options to 
consider—a successful CBDC introduction could 
prove highly disruptive to the traditional banking 
sector and could simultaneously spur a new wave of 
financial services innovation.  

Estimates vary widely on the potential reduction 
in commercial bank revenues stemming from a 
successful retail CBDC launch, but the combined 
affect on interest (through deposit substitution) 
and transaction fees (erosion of payments volumes) 
could quickly reach billions of euros. A more 
moderate degree of market uptake and CBDCs 
targeted to specific use cases—wholesale, cross-
border or financial inclusion—would, of course, have 
a smaller impact.

Nonfinancial actors also will feel the impact. 
Merchants and consumers embracing CBDCs 
may be enticed by fully digital payment processes 
featuring lower transaction fees and faster 
settlement. Corporates and governments could 
benefit from CBDCs through faster and cheaper 
transfer of capital (including government subsidies) 
and enhanced risk control.

While it is possible that governments could mandate 
CBDC acceptance by all payees through a legal-
tender process and perhaps require their use given 
certain transaction criteria, a mandate in itself 
is not sufficient to ensure widespread adoption. 
Therefore, promoting some form of demonstrable 
benefits for participants, banks, payment players, 
and nonfinancial actors will be necessary. Creation 
of this business case for the economy as a whole will 
remain a key point of reflection for CBDC projects.

Central banks as CBDC architects
Each of the multiple CBDC design options is suited 
to a different set of strategic objectives. As central 
banks set their priorities and determine how best to 
achieve them, we believe they should consider five 
questions:

1.  What is the end game in terms of adoption and 
ubiquity compared with traditional money? 
Business cases and scenarios should be 
based on a market assessment of the current 

and future payments landscape and realistic 
adoption goals.

2.  Which constituency(ies) does the CBDC aim 
to address? The first step in achieving CBDC 
policy goals is determining scope. A focus on 
any combination of user segments—private 
citizens (consumers), commercial banks, and 
corporations—can be effective. Design choices 
should be based on the business cases and 
features most valued by users. Decisions should 
draw upon extensive expertise building fintech 
assets, often from outside of traditional central 
bank organizations.  

3.  What role will the central bank play? 

Participation could be deep or light, and the 
adoption goal may be best accomplished by 
establishing PPPs that leverage long-standing 
relationships with commercial banks and key 
corporate entities.

4.  What resources and capabilities will be 

required? Central banks are likely to need 
new decision-making processes. Request-
for-proposal (RFP) processes can be valuable 
exercises to assess technology options. In 
addition, central banks should develop 
enhanced change management practices and 
acquire new talent experienced in developing 
partnerships.

5.  What changes will central banks need to enforce 
beyond payments? Regulatory changes would 
be required to achieve several of the previously 
stated objectives. Hurdles in regulation, 
commerce enablement, and fiscal rights will 
need to be cleared. Goals like financial inclusion, 
to cite one example, could be advanced by 
reducing minimum balance thresholds, made 
possible by lower costs, as well as simplifying 
(without weakening) KYC checks through digital 
ID solutions.

By adopting an agile approach, central banks can 
deploy a CBDC within three years, compared with 
five years or more using a traditional waterfall 
development model (Exhibit 1). Although adoption 
and realization of scale will likely prove to be longer-

term efforts, lessons from early launches and a 
set of best practices (Exhibit 2) can help foster 
early market acceptance.

A key role for commercial banks
Public–private partnerships will be essential to 
the success of a CBDC launch, enabling central 
banks to leverage established infrastructure 
and client relationships. Such alliances will help 
central banks implement use cases aligned with 
end-user needs, complementing their gaps in 
capabilities and knowledge of consumption 
habits, particularly in a retail scenario. By 
engaging commercial banks and other private 
stakeholders (technology enablers, merchants, 
users) in the launch process, central banks 
will also foster a broader sense of ownership, 
manage fears of displacement, and increase the 
probability of successful adoption.

Different countries will likely pursue CBDC 
models aligned with their specific goals, 
capabilities, and stakeholders. The resulting 
multi-model environment will require global 
banks to clearly state their CBDC strategy—both 
globally and locally—and engage with central 
banks in other countries.

We offer a few key questions that should 
be helpful for commercial banks in framing 
productive conversations about adapting to 
CBDC models. 

 — What benefits and objectives is a central 

bank pursuing with its rollout, and what 
are the implications for bank and nonbank 
competitors in the region? Launches 
prioritizing efficiency gains, for instance, may 
alter the competitive battleground, giving 
commercial banks a platform to compete with 
fintechs’ cross-border transfer solutions, or 
the other way around.

 — What role do commercial banks seek to play 
in the new ecosystem, consistent with their 
overall strategy, digital capabilities, and 
available capital? Engagement models may 
include “first movers” who co-create an 
emerging CBDC ecosystem and “selective 
adopters” who incrementally adjust existing 
capabilities to accommodate CBDCs. Players 
must identify the primary risks and benefits 
associated with this position, assess their 
likelihood and impact, and determine 
potential mitigation levers.

modeled for both the bank and its clients, and 
the implications shared early on with the relevant 
supervisory bodies. The capabilities required 
to implement such strategies must also be 
assessed, recognizing that multiple forms of 
digital coins may well coexist for some period, if 
not permanently.

What next? A CBDC reality check
Most CBDC launches remain too new to assess fully, 
but as demonstrated in the sidebar, early adoption 
has been mostly tepid. What is holding back central 
banks from achieving their goals more rapidly? Early 
experience reveals four primary hurdles for effective 
rollouts:

stakeholder groups, develop deep technical 
know-how (design options, technological 
requirements, and so on), and establish robust 
implementation and monitoring capabilities.

2.  A clear or substantiated market value 

proposition has yet to be documented. Some 
consider CBDC benefits to be limited relative 
to already-established private solutions. 
CBDCs, which are non-interest-bearing in 
most models, rarely offer advanced features 
like smart contracts.

3.  Trust remains a hurdle for a meaningful 

share of citizens and system participants, 
who question the motives behind CBDCs 
(often suspecting governments of aiming to 
monitor or restrict financial activities) or fear 
cybersecurity risks.

1.  Many central banks have struggled to manage 
CBDC projects across an array of development 
stages, from research to full rollout, as they 
need to foster alignment across multiple 

interruptions suffered by some existing 
solutions, as well as the digital divide that 
exists in rural areas and faces certain small 
businesses. 

4.  Technical challenges are evidenced by service

Central bank digital currencies: An active role for commercial banks

With most central banks either in a pilot 
phase or in the process of developing a 
CBDC, progress is poised to continue over the 
coming year. Although we have yet to see a 
fully successful rollout, the policy objectives 
underpinning many of these pilots is likely to 
ensure significant pressure for adoption. Given 
the ongoing decline in cash usage, broad-
based interest in digital assets, and persistent 
concerns about sovereignty and monetary 
stability, central banks appear highly motivated 
to continue exploring the potential of CBDCs.

Nonetheless, CBDC launches involve some 
meaningful risks for the existing banking and 

payments landscape, whether via payment 
system cannibalization, flight of commercial bank 
deposits to a “risk free” CBDC alternative during 
times of financial uncertainty, or exceptional 
pressure on prices and costs of existing payment 
systems. Unless properly planned for across the 
ecosystem, a widely adopted CBDC could fuel 
significant disruption of legacy financial services 
economics and customer relationships. Banks 
and payments players will of course still need 
to determine a positive CBDC business case in 
order to gain internal support and endorsement.

A successful CBDC launch is likely to require 
cooperation between central and commercial 
banks, in an effort to develop a more inclusive 
and efficient monetary system with a sustainable 
business case. For either party, a go-it-alone 
course of action is far less likely to succeed.

Sustaining digital payments 
growth: Winning models in 
emerging markets

Digital payment transactions are skyrocketing in emerging markets as 
innovations proliferate. Banks, fintechs, and telecom companies must 
quickly develop their strategy to compete for market share.

Digital payment transactions have grown rapidly 
in emerging markets during the past two years, as 
the pandemic accelerated shifts to contactless 
payments and e-commerce.¹ E-wallets proliferated, 
real-time account-to-account transfers took off, 
and industry players formed new partnerships to 
access capabilities and broaden their customer 
base. Some of the fastest growth in digital payments 
occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia, where low 
banking penetration gives payments providers 
opportunities to capture untapped potential and 
reach underserved populations.

Along with new opportunities, banks, telecom 
companies, and fintechs have experienced 
intensified competition. Banks maintain a leading 
position in payments in most countries, but 
nonbanks own the dominant front-end payment 
application in some emerging markets, including 
India, Kenya, the Philippines, and Vietnam. 

This article addresses the remarkable opportunities 
and competitive pressures of the fast-growing 
emerging markets. We explore which digital 
payments models are best placed to gain 
momentum in these markets, which monetization 
paths payments providers are likely to pursue, and 
what innovations may lie on the horizon.

Digital payments continue to increase
Globally, between 2018 and 2021, the number 
of noncash retail payment transactions have 
increased at a compound annual growth rate of 13 
percent; while in emerging markets, that figure is 
25 percent. Some of the fastest growth occurred in 
emerging markets in Africa (Morocco, Nigeria, and 
South Africa) and Asia. Strong growth is expected 
to continue in some emerging markets over the 

next few years, with projected CAGRs of 15 percent 
between 2021 and 2026.

Four major trends have driven the growth in digital 
payments. First, the pandemic accelerated the 
shift from cash to contactless digital payments that 
was already under way among consumers. Second, 
e-commerce continued to grow and evolve, with 
global volumes increasing by 25 percent between 
2019 and 2020 and expected to grow by 12 to 15 
percent a year to 2025.² Third, government pushes for 
cashless payments to facilitate interoperability, plug 
tax leakages, and ensure the effective distribution of 
aid accelerated the take-up of new digital payment 
systems such as Wave in Côte d’Ivoire, UPI in India, 
and Pix in Brazil. Finally, investors’ appetite for 
digital payments grew, leading to a proliferation of 
payments-focused fintechs. In Africa, for instance, 
these firms accounted for about 40 percent of the 
$5.2 billion in tech start-up capital in 2021.³ 

Despite this explosion in digital retail payments, cash 
remains king in some markets. In Africa, it was used 
in 95 percent of transactions in 2021, according to 
McKinsey’s Global Payments Map. Cash is distributed 
via extensive networks of retail agents: for instance. 
M-Pesa has more than 600,000 agents across seven 
African countries,⁴ and MTN has more than 970,000 
across the continent.⁵  These agents help less 
digitally savvy customers make bill payments, buy 
airtime, access cash from their wallets, and conduct 
other transactions. Cash is still the top in-person 
point-of-sale (POS) payment method in Southeast 
Asian markets, including Thailand (where it accounts 
for 63 percent of POS transaction value), Vietnam (54 
percent), Indonesia (51 percent), and the Philippines 
(48 percent).⁶  In Latin America, where credit and 
debit cards are more established, cash accounts for 
36 percent of POS transaction value.⁷

noncash payments made by and to businesses, individuals, and governments. “Emerging markets” refers to markets in emerging Asian 
countries, Africa, and Latin America.

Sustaining digital payments growth: Winning models in emerging markets

The emerging markets where banks are the 
strongest, such as Brazil and Nigeria, tend 
to have a solid payments infrastructure and 
a captive customer base stemming from his-
torical first-mover advantage or regulatory 
restrictions on alternative rails.

Banks and third-party wallets compete 
for share
In most emerging markets, the main contest for 
providing digital payments is between banks, with 
their mobile banking apps and wallets, and third-
party mobile wallets owned by telecom companies, 
e-commerce platforms, and other ecosystem 
participants. Which side comes out ahead is likely 
to vary by country and depends to a large extent on 
market structure (Exhibit 1).

Markets where banks lead 
The emerging markets where banks are the 
strongest, such as Brazil and Nigeria, tend to have 
a solid payments infrastructure and a captive 
customer base stemming from historical first-
mover advantage or regulatory restrictions on 
alternative rails. Banks also retain a leading position 
in markets where financial inclusion and card 
penetration are low and regulatory regimes have not 
permitted nonbanks to offer wallets to underserved 
populations.

In some markets with well-established banking 
infrastructure, governments have intervened to set 
up unified payment systems that offer instant bank 
transfers free or for a small charge. In the two years 
since its launch, Brazil’s Pix has reached 122 million 
customers (equivalent to more than half of the 
population), more than 775 registered participants 
(including banks, government agencies, and other 
institutions), and some two billion transactions a 
month.⁸ In India, UPI has attracted more than 300 
registered banks, close to 260 million users, and 
almost six billion transactions a month.⁹ 

Banks in emerging markets may also want to take 
note of the strategies followed by their counterparts 
in developed markets such as Singapore and Hong 
Kong. Some banks are launching their own wallets, 
such as DBS PayLah! by DBS in Singapore. Others 
offer a wallet-like user experience on their mobile 
banking app and enable customers to complete 
transactions by scanning a quick response (QR) 
code or using a near-field communication (NFC)

device. Yet others are partnering with Apple Pay, 
Samsung Pay, and Google Pay to ensure they keep 
the balances of customers’ checking and savings 
accounts even if they miss out on the last mile of 
payments.

Some of these developed-market banks are 
now extending their digital wallets into emerging 
markets. For example, DBS recently announced a 
partnership with Nets and UnionPay International 
to make PayLah! available in 45 markets, including 
Malaysia and Thailand.¹0

Markets where nonbank wallets are ahead 
Nonbank wallets tend to do best in markets with 
less developed payments infrastructure and 
where telecom companies and other providers 

face no regulatory barriers in creating strong value 
propositions to reach underserved customers. In 
Kenya and Ghana, for instance, telecom companies’ 
first-mover advantage and innovative efforts to 
extend financial services to mass markets via mobile 
wallets have resulted in very high penetration levels. 

Wallets are the leading e-commerce payment 
method in the Philippines (accounting for 31 percent 
of transaction value), Vietnam (25 percent), and 
Indonesia (39 percent), and they take second 
place in Thailand after bank transfers.¹¹ Some 
wallets have achieved very high penetration levels 
in these markets. In the Philippines, for example, 
the registered users of the top two wallets, GCash 
and Maya, account for 83 and 65 percent of adults, 
respectively.¹² Such successes can partly be

ascribed to the digital know-your-customer (KYC) 
processes that enable wallets to offer customers 
a quick and easy onboarding experience. However, 
as regulatory regimes are simplified and banks 
are allowed to offer a fully digital KYC process 
instead of requiring new customers to visit a 
branch, this advantage will be eroded. Moreover, 
banks will benefit from the introduction of new QR 
standards—such as QRIS in Indonesia and QRPh in 
the Philippines—that are forcing wallets to open up 
their proprietary QR networks to bank apps.

An evolving landscape
Meanwhile, banks are using easy instant payments 
(for instance, those offered by Pix in Brazil) and 
more user-friendly apps to encroach on territory 
previously carved out by wallets. Wallets have high 
adoption; more than 70 percent of the respondents 
to a recent survey¹³ said they use digital wallets, 
with an average of three different wallets each. 
However, frequency of use and volumes transacted 
remain stubbornly low. In Brazil, half of the 
respondents to a McKinsey payments survey said 
they spent no more than 300 reais ($56) a month 
through their digital wallets.¹⁴ Despite heavy 
investment in rewards to acquire customers, wallet 
providers apparently have yet to create a value 
proposition strong enough to significantly change 
usage levels.

Meanwhile, banks and wallets are shaping a 
variety of partnerships to access capabilities, 
enhance their value proposition, and extend 
their geographic reach. In Africa, for instance, 
M-Pesa has partnered with KCB and NCBA to 
offer overdraft and microloan products, while the 
Tanzanian mobile remittance provider NALA has 
partnered with Equity Bank to gain access to the 
Kenyan market.¹⁵

Successful wallets will be part of ecosystems
Wallets are more embedded in customers’ 
daily lives when they are part of ecosystems. 
This enables them to grow by extending into 
e-commerce, ride hailing, food delivery, messaging, 
travel, and other adjacent categories. For instance, 

prominent ride-hailing players in Southeast Asia, 
such as Grab and Gojek, are looking to capitalize on 
their high-frequency use and rich customer data by 
extending into groceries and other categories with 
larger ticket sizes. Players with higher ticket sizes 
but lower frequency of use, including e-commerce 
platforms Jumia in Africa and Shopee in Southeast 
Asia, are pushing in the opposite direction, seeking 
to boost user engagement through gamification and 
other approaches.

In Africa, M-Pesa morphed from a mobile money 
service into an ecosystem by forming partnerships 
to create a super app with seamlessly integrated 
mini apps in e-commerce, travel, health, agriculture, 
and other categories. User engagement and 
monthly revenue per user have risen, with more than 
a million monthly active users since the launch of 
the super app in 2021.¹⁶ In Latin America, Rappi—a 
Colombia-based, on-demand delivery service with 
more than 30 million users and a presence in more 
than 100 cities in nine countries—has expanded 
its super app into offerings such as e-commerce, 
insurance, and loyalty points.

Wallets that are not part of an ecosystem involving 
e-commerce, social media, or ride hailing will find 
it tougher to succeed, since capturing customer 
mindshare is difficult when use cases are limited 
(Exhibit 2). Exceptions can be found, however, in 
markets where wallets have a significant first-mover 
advantage, such as MoMo in Vietnam.

Profitability remains a challenge in 
digital payments
Margins for digital payments providers are already 
wafer thin and are likely to be eroded further by 
competitive intensity and declining fees. In many 
cases, payments are more a means to cross-sell 
other products than a profit center in their own 
right. Some services, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) 
payments, are usually offered to users for free 
in most markets. In Brazil, for instance, Pix is 
pushing margins down by offering P2P payments 
for free and person-to-merchant (P2M) payments

at low cost. One of the few providers charging 
for P2P payments is M-Pesa, but it is coming 
under increasing pressure to reduce its charges, 
especially after adjusting its fee structure as part of 
pandemic-relief efforts.¹⁷ 

However, they are exploring monetization paths to 
create profitable income streams and introducing 
innovative new features to broaden and deepen 
their customer base.

Not only do digital payments providers face 
squeezed margins, they also incur high acquisition 
and engagement costs because of the constant 
promotions needed to attract new customers and 
encourage more frequent use among the existing 
base. In addition, the cost of cash remains a 
challenge for wallets, though it is starting to come 
down as banking penetration improves. Globally, the 
majority of mobile wallets continue to post losses. 

Wallets are exploring several monetization paths
To create profitable income streams, wallets 
are entering other payment arenas, such as bill 
payment, merchant services, and remittances. 
They are offering a more comprehensive range of 
financial services, including investment and wealth 
management, lending, and insurance. And they are 
providing lifestyle services, including transport, 
e-commerce, and food delivery to become a one-
stop shop for consumers (Exhibit 3).¹⁸

Extended payments. In extended payments, 
wallets are offering a range of services, including 
merchant services such as universal payments 
acceptance, business digitization, loyalty programs, 

inventory management, and reconciliation. For 
example, MoMo offers merchants a set of tools 
to improve discoverability, access a voucher 
marketplace, and integrate loyalty programs.

Financial services. Wallets’ offerings span several 
types of financial services:

 — Investment and wealth management services 
include micro investments for mass and upper-
mass markets, money-market funds, and 
linked high-interest bank accounts with easy 
onboarding. In the Philippines, for instance, 
GCash partnered with CIMB Bank to launch 
GSave, which allows users to open a savings 
account from inside the GCash app without 
an initial deposit or maintaining a balance. 
Launched in 2018, GSave had a reported  
5.3 million digital deposit account holders by 
May 2022.¹⁹ In 2019, GCash launched GInvest 
to offer users opportunities to invest in money-
market funds and listed unit investment trust 
funds (UITFs) for a very low initial investment. 
By 2022, it reported having more than a 
million registered accounts, a 7 percent share 
of domestic UITFs, and 77 percent of UITF 
accounts.²0 

 — Lending can take place through partnerships 
or by using the wallet’s own balance sheet. 
In Indonesia, OVO has bought a P2P license 
to overcome its lack of a lending license. In 
Africa, M-Pesa has taken advantage of its 
large subscriber base to pursue partnerships 
with banks to offer microlending and 
overdraft facilities. Wave, a wallet focused 
on Francophone West Africa, has recently 
received a regional e-money license that will 
enable it to extend its product portfolio by 
offering credit through partners.

 — Insurance offerings include travel, health, 

personal accident, and other forms of coverage. 
In Brazil, for instance, PicPay has launched 
customizable insurance to protect users from 
unauthorized Pix transactions, money transfers, 
and purchases made using cards registered in 
users’ e-wallets.²¹

trend most advanced in Asia. In the Philippines, 
the recently launched Maya app integrates 
Maya Bank’s digital savings, credit, and other 
banking services with PayMaya’s wallet and other 
cryptocurrency, micro-investment, and insurance 
offerings. In India, Paytm obtained a bank license 
from RBI and transitioned into Paytm Payments 
Bank. Though becoming a bank subjects wallets to 
higher capital requirements and greater regulatory 
oversight, it also allows them to monetize their 
surplus balances and offer their customers a broad 
suite of lending products.

Consumer lifestyle services. Wallets are also 
expanding into consumer lifestyle services in areas 
such as transport, e-commerce, entertainment, 
travel, and discount vouchers. In addition, they 
provide data services that enable mini-app 
providers to personalize their advertising. Being 
part of a super app gives these mini-app players 
access to an extensive customer base in return for 
a share of the revenues generated.

Some wallets are generating large income streams 
from distributor licenses for prepaid phone 
airtime or vouchers for video games and other 
services. After its launch in 2014, MoMo’s mobile 
wallet gained most of its early revenues through 
airtime top-ups, having partnered with every 
telecommunications network in Vietnam. These 
relationships have since expanded to allow MoMo 
users to buy movie tickets, airline tickets, and 
online-gaming credit.²² 

In the future, some emerging-market wallets may 
wish to take advantage of their payment rails and 
credit-scoring systems by offering a platform-
as-a-service solution, as global remittance 
player Wise has done with its Wise Platform. This 
would allow wallets to monetize their underlying 
technology and contribute to the development of 
other payments ecosystems.

As wallets extend their offerings into a wider range 
of payment solutions and financial services, some 
of them are transitioning into digital banks, a 

Innovative features are being introduced to add 
more value for customers

Sustaining digital payments growth: Winning models in emerging markets

globally, we have identified innovative features and 
functions that wallets are introducing to create 
added value. The following are a few examples:

 — Green initiatives. Some wallets address 

customer and societal desire for action on 
environmental sustainability and climate 
change by supporting eco-friendly initiatives. 
For example, G-Forest offers GCash users 
green energy points for using cashless services 
or accessing their health app via GCash. By 
accumulating points, users can plant a virtual 
tree, which GCash matches by planting a real 
one. GCash reported that by January 2022, the 
scheme had attracted nine million registered 
users and “virtually planted” a million trees.²³ 
Some global apps are starting to include carbon-
tracking features. ING, for example, is working 
with fintech Cogo to allow customers to measure 
the carbon footprint of their expenditures.²⁴ As 
consumers in emerging markets become more 
sensitive to sustainability issues, more wallets 
are likely to offer environmental features like 
these.

 — Loyalty programs and rewards for meeting 

personal goals. To drive customer adoption and 
use, wallets offer loyalty programs or reward 
customers for meeting their own goals. For 
instance, users of the Toss app in Vietnam can 
set targets for the number of steps they will take 
each day. Those who hit their daily target receive 
loyalty points they can redeem for discounts.

 — Products with social features. In China, WeChat 

and Alipay have extended the tradition of 

giving red packets of cash for Lunar New Year 
by offering a digital equivalent. Launched in 
2014, the service grew to more than 800 million 
users by 2018. Similarly, MoMo’s “lucky money” 
program enables users to exchange digital gifts 
and win rewards redeemable at partner stores.

Meanwhile, some wallets are pursuing innovations in 
cross-border transfers, which have remained costly 
and slow. In Africa, Chipper Cash has targeted 
specific remittance corridors; other players, such 
as MFS Africa, are looking to take advantage of 
intracontinental switches. Still others are using 
blockchain applications to reduce fees, as seen 
in Flutterwave’s partnership with the Stellar 
network to power corridors between Africa and the 
European Union. 

Digital payment services have become an attractive 
and dynamic feature of the payments landscape 
in emerging countries. In particular, some new 
fintechs providing payment solutions have been 
able to grow rapidly during an era of cheap funding. 
But in the absence of a clear path to profitability, 
they may lose out to banks and other incumbent 
payments providers over time unless they can build 
a successful ecosystem around their core business. 
In a tighter funding environment, new entrants 
would be well advised to give careful consideration 
to market structures, monetization paths, and 
opportunities for innovation before venturing in with 
offerings of their own.
