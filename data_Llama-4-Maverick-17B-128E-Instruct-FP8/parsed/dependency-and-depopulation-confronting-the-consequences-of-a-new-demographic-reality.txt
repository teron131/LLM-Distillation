The McKinsey Global Institute was established in 1990. Our mission is to provide a fact base to 
aid decision making on the economic and business issues most critical to the world’s companies 
and policy leaders. We benefit from the full range of McKinsey’s regional, sectoral, and functional 
knowledge, skills, and expertise, but editorial direction and decisions are solely the responsibility of 
MGI directors and partners.

Our research is currently grouped into five major themes:

 — Productivity and prosperity: Creating and harnessing the world’s assets most productively

Dependency and depopulation?At a glance

 — Falling fertility rates are propelling major economies toward population collapse in this 
century. Two-thirds of humanity lives in countries with fertility below the replacement rate of 
2.1 children per family. By 2100, populations in some major economies will fall by 20 to 50 percent, 
based on UN projections.

 — Age structures are inverting—from pyramids to obelisks—as the number of older people 
grows and the number of younger people shrinks. The first wave of this demographic shift 
is hitting advanced economies and China, where the share of people of working age will fall to 
59 percent in 2050, from 67 percent today. Later waves will engulf younger regions within one or 
two generations. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only exception. 

 — Consumers and workers will be older and increasingly in the developing world. Seniors will 
account for one-quarter of global consumption by 2050, double their share in 1997. Developing 
countries will provide a growing share of global labor supply and of consumption, making their 
productivity and prosperity vital for global growth.

 — The current calculus of economies cannot support existing income and retirement norms—
something must give. In first wave countries across advanced economies and China, GDP 
per capita growth could slow by 0.4 percent annually on average from 2023 to 2050, and up 
to 0.8 percent in some countries, unless productivity growth increases by two to four times or 
people work one to five hours more per week. Retirement systems might need to channel as 
much as 50 percent of labor income to fund a 1.5-time increase in the gap between the aggregate 
consumption and income of seniors. Later wave countries, take note.

 — In confronting the consequences of demographic change, societies enter uncharted 

waters. Absent action, younger people will inherit lower economic growth and shoulder the cost 
of more retirees, while the traditional flow of wealth between generations erodes. Long-standing 
work practices and the social contract must change. More fundamentally, countries will need to 
raise fertility rates to avert depopulation—a societal shift without precedent in modern history.

Dependency and depopulation?Introduction 

Families across the globe are having fewer and fewer children. In much of the world, fertility rates 
have fallen below the replacement rate required to maintain a stable population, and, despite 
increasing longevity, some countries have already started to see population decline. Others may 
follow in the not-so-distant future.1

Falling fertility rates shift the demographic balance toward youth scarcity and more older people, 
who are dependent on a shrinking working-age population. Longer life spans accelerate the shift. 
This phenomenon has begun to play out across advanced economies and China, where in three-fifths 
of countries annual deaths already exceed births.2 Emerging economies have more runway, but they 
face the need to get richer before the demographic transformation sets in. 

Our current economic systems and social contracts have developed over decades of growing 
populations, in particular working-age populations that drive economic growth and support and 
sustain people living longer lives. This calculus no longer holds. 

A combination of higher productivity, more work per person, effective migration, and higher fertility 
rates can ensure global prosperity for the future. That said, no one of those levers alone will be 
enough, and each presents challenges. Bending the trajectory of the demographic shift will require 
society to rethink existing systems for work and retirement in ways that may compel a change in our 
social contract—no easy feat. 

This report first explores the demographic shifts driven by falling fertility rates, until recently a 
trend primarily of interest to demographers and actuaries but now a topic of global conversation.3 
Chapters 2 and 3 provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential economic consequences of 
falling fertility rates combined with longer life spans. The first wave of aging economies has started 
to feel the impacts on economic growth, labor markets, consumption, and public finances. Later 
waves of aging will hit emerging economies, which are expected to face a similar fate just one to 
two generations later. We conclude with implications and recommendations for policy makers, 
businesses, and society.

While the global population last declined significantly during the bubonic plague of the Middle 
Ages, which is believed to have killed roughly half of Europeans, the demographic shift we are living 
through today is in many ways a result of vast improvements in global health, welfare, and prosperity.4 
Humanity has demonstrated incredible resourcefulness throughout its history, and no doubt will find 
opportunities to thrive amid the challenges that a worldwide change in demographics poses.

1. The age of 
youth scarcity

As well-being and prosperity increase around the world, two outcomes—fewer children and longer 
lives—are reshaping global populations. Over the past several decades, families have shrunk in size 
virtually everywhere. In much of the world today, the total fertility rate, which we refer to as the fertility 
rate, is below the replacement rate of 2.1, which is the number of children needed to replace their 
parents.5 (Demographic terms used in this report are defined in the glossary.) As a result, the global 
age mix is shifting. While many people call this phenomenon “aging,” in fact the declining number 
of young people—a youth deficit—is driving the bulk of the demographic shift, a phenomenon we 
explore in this chapter. 

While declining fertility rates and changing population patterns are occurring everywhere, a first 
wave of regions, generally higher-income ones, has already begun to experience the effects of the 
demographic shift over the past several decades. Later waves of the same challenge will wash over 
many emerging economies in the next one to two generations.

Falling fertility is reshaping populations—everywhere 
Today in more than half of the world’s countries, home to two-thirds of humanity, the fertility rate 
has dropped below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. Globally, the fertility rate 
averaged 2.3 children per woman in 2023, just over the replacement rate.6 Over the past quarter 
century, the fertility rate has declined in 90 percent of the world’s countries (see sidebar “What is 
the fertility rate?”). 

The story of collapsing demographics starts in Luxembourg, the first country the United Nations 
recorded as having a fertility rate below replacement in 1950, when it first started collecting data 
(Exhibit 1). The country’s fertility rate rebounded in the 1950s, however, making Serbia and Croatia, 
both part of Yugoslavia at the time, the first countries where fertility permanently dropped below the 
replacement threshold, in 1963 and in 1968, respectively. Within a year, fertility rates in Denmark, 
Finland, and Luxembourg had followed suit. None of these countries has had a fertility rate equal to or 
above replacement since then. 

Twenty years later, most countries in Advanced Asia, Europe, and North America had crossed 
the replacement fertility threshold, and China joined them in 1991. Subsequently, fertility rates 
in countries at varying levels of economic development around the world have fallen below 
replacement—in Thailand in 1989, Mexico in 2015, and India in 2019. Sub-Saharan Africa is the one 
region of the world today where fertility rates remain high and are likely to stay above the replacement 
rate beyond the next quarter century.

Sidebar: What is the  
fertility rate?

The word “fertility” has a different meaning in 
the vernacular compared with its use among 
demographers. Colloquially, fertility often 
refers to whether a person is able to conceive 
a child. But demographers focus on fertility 
rates, a measure of the average number of 
children women have throughout their life. 

Measuring the average number of children 
per woman in any given generation is 
straightforward once that generation has 
passed childbearing age. For example, the 
calculation today is easy for any cohort of 
women born before about 1970. However, 
this reflects only old information rather than 
providing an indication of how many children 
families are having today or are likely to have 
over their lives. 

To characterize the fertility rate in any given 
year, demographers measure the total 
fertility rate, which is a so-called period 
metric. The United Nations measures 
total fertility rate as the average number 
of children that would be born alive to a 
woman during her lifetime, assuming she 
were to pass through her childbearing years 
conforming to the age-specific fertility rates 
in that year.1 Age-specific fertility measures 
the number of children that women in each 

age bracket have in the reference period and 
is typically collected for five-year brackets 
ranging from 15 to 50 years.

and may be slightly higher or lower based on 
differences in child mortality and sex ratios 
at birth.2

The total fertility rate may differ from what 
cohort fertility rates ultimately end up being 
for many reasons—age-specific fertility rates 
change over time, for example. Fertility rates 
could be underestimated if younger women 
today end up having the same number of 
children as younger women 15 years ago, 
only later. In this case, the measured fertility 
rate will fall today, even if the eventual 
number of children born per woman is the 
same. Conversely, fertility rates may be 
overestimated for today’s childbearing 
cohort if the number of children they have in 
later adulthood continues to fall relative to 
older cohorts. Nonetheless, the total fertility 
rate provides a set of harmonized estimates 
that can be compared across societies, 
traced over time, and used to predict 
population size.  

Population size is expected to remain 
flat if the fertility rate is at replacement 
level, defined by the United Nations as 
approximately 2.1 children per woman. This 
represents the average number of children 
a woman would need to give birth to in order 
to ensure that she is replaced by a daughter 
who survives to childbearing age. The true 
replacement rate also varies across countries 

In the long run and setting migration aside, 
the population of a society with a fertility 
rate above replacement is expected to grow, 
while the population of one with a fertility 
rate below replacement is expected to 
shrink. However, this rule of thumb doesn’t 
necessarily hold in the short term, since 
population size also depends on the number 
of women of childbearing age and life 
expectancy. 

There are myriad causes for fertility changes 
around the world, ranging from societal 
shifts to deeply personal decisions. In this 
report, we do not explore the causes of 
declining fertility rates but rather examine 
their potential economic consequences. 
For a discussion of the causes of declining 
fertility rates, see, for example, Pablo Alvarez, 
“What does the global decline of the fertility 
rate look like?” World Economic Forum, 
June 2022; Nicholas Eberstadt, “The age of 
depopulation: Surviving a world gone grey,” 
Foreign Affairs, November/December 2024; 
and Alice Evans, “Why is fertility collapsing, 
globally?” The Great Gender Divergence,

 Alternatively, new research measures the effective fertility rate, which accounts for child mortality and brings the replacement rate to 2. The research finds that a portion of 
declining total fertility rates compensates for higher survival rates—although since the 1990s, this has only been the case in Sub-Saharan Africa, where child mortality rates 
remained high. See Anup Malani and Ari Jacob, A new measure of surviving children that sheds light on long-term trends in fertility, National Bureau of Economic Research

Dependency and depopulation?At the same time, life expectancy has increased almost everywhere.7 But greater longevity explains 
just 20 percent of the change in the age profiles of populations in developed countries since 1960; 
falling fertility rates explain the rest (Exhibit 2). 

Consider the combined impact of these two forces in Germany. From 1960 to 2021, 26 million fewer 
babies were born, a number equivalent to 31 percent of the German population at the end of that 
period, than if fertility rates had remained constant at the 1960 level. Seven million more seniors, or 
about 8 percent of the country’s population, were alive at the end of the period due to increased life 
expectancy over the same period. Net-net, the country’s population in 2021 was 23 percent smaller 
than it would have been had both fertility and life expectancy rates remained constant, equivalent to 
roughly 19 million fewer people.

Japan is the only developed country in our research where life expectancy had roughly the same 
impact as fertility. This unusual pattern was due to two factors. First, Japan already had a very low 
fertility rate in 1960—1.98 compared with, for example, 2.7 in the United Kingdom at that time. And life 
expectancy at 65 increased more in Japan than in other countries—by nine years compared with six 
years in the United Kingdom. 

In emerging economies, fertility rates fell even more dramatically from 1960 to 2023. For instance, a 
woman had an average of 6.1 babies in Brazil in 1960, whereas today, she has 1.6 children.

Dependency and depopulation?Global life expectancy has extended by seven years on average since 1997, reaching 73 years in 2023 
and set to hit 77 years by 2050. Centenarians, or those 100 years and older, are the fastest-growing 
age group in percentage terms, according to the United Nations. Yet for all the attention paid to rising 
longevity, declining fertility more powerfully determines global demographics.

Populations morph from pyramids into obelisks 
Due to the demographic shifts we’ve described, what demographers call population pyramids are 
shaped less and less like pyramids today. To analyze how population structures are shifting over time, 
we’ve grouped the world’s countries into ten regions: Advanced Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, 
Emerging Asia, Greater China, India, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, 
North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Western Europe (for more on our classification and data, 
see sidebar “Pyramid foundations: Demystifying the approach”). In most regions, these structures 
now resemble shallots, and in more economically advanced ones, they are taking on the shape of 
obelisks (Exhibit 3).

Societies are shaped in large part by their age structures, and their economic priorities shift as their 
population pyramids invert. The amount of physically intensive work done versus the number of 
physical therapists needed, or the number of families adding nurseries to their homes rather than 
adding accessory dwelling units to house aging parents, depends on the mix of younger and older 
people in a population. 

Crucially, pension entitlements kick in between 60 and 67 years of age in many economies, 
particularly in advanced ones. At that point, seniors become recipients of “support” provided by the 
working-age population, those aged 15 to 64, who generate most of the income and pay most of the 
taxes that support older people. Without significant changes, the world’s aging population means a 
growing number of older people who aren’t working will require the support of a shrinking number 
of younger people who are. Even if global fertility rates were to jump overnight to the replacement 
rate, it would take 20 years, give or take, for those additional babies to become adults and begin 
contributing to economic growth through work.  

Sidebar: Pyramid foundations: 
Demystifying the approach

In this report, we explore the implications 
of changing demographics by analyzing 
projected population shifts based on United 
Nations forecasts. We examine the outcomes 
across different waves to understand the 
impact over various time horizons. 

We have consolidated the world into ten 
regions to present our findings, and each of 
the 237 countries and areas in the UN World 
Population Prospects 2024 is individually 
accounted for so that global populations 
sum to the total. Our first wave regions 
include Advanced Asia (Australia, Japan, 
New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea), 
Western Europe, Greater China, Central 
and Eastern Europe, and North America. 
Later waves encompass Latin America and 
the Caribbean, India, the Middle East and 
North Africa, Emerging Asia (economies not 
included in Advanced Asia, India, or Greater 
China), and Sub-Saharan Africa.  

Throughout the report, we rely on 20 
countries for examples. For first wave regions, 
those countries are Australia, China, France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, 
the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
Together, these countries account for 28 

percent of global population and generate 
65 percent of the world’s nominal GDP. The 
example countries from later wave regions 
are Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, 
India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Thailand, 
and Türkiye. These countries account for 35 
percent of global population and 12 percent of 
nominal GDP.

Most of our data sources are publicly available 
and standardized. The future population 
projections in this report are based on 
the medium scenario from the UN World 
Population Prospects 2024, which covers 237 
geographic entities, mostly countries. The 
report includes population estimates from the 
1950s to the present, as well as projections 
through 2100. Additionally, we have 
supplemented our analysis with income and 
consumption data from the National Transfer 
Accounts Project; labor market data from the 
International Labour Organization’s ILOSTAT 
and The Conference Board; and additional 
information from Eurostat, the OECD, and, 
where applicable, national statistical offices. 
We also use consumption data from World 
Data Lab and supplement our economic 
analyses with Oxford Economics data, which 
are not publicly available.

Throughout the report, our analysis takes a 
ceteris paribus approach, holding all variables 

constant except demographic change, to 
isolate its effect. Our approach has two 
key limitations to highlight. First, ceteris 
paribus outcomes throughout this report 
are not predictions; rather, they are thought 
experiments to explore to what degree 
current economic systems “add up” in future 
demographic realities and to understand the 
ways in which they do not. These calculations 
are not dynamic, but we readily acknowledge 
that ceteris paribus never holds in practice. 
For example, we do not consider the impact of 
aging directly on productivity within countries, 
on personal savings rates, and so forth.1 
Societies are highly adaptable, and they must 
and will adapt in ways that our calculations do 
not attempt to anticipate. In fact, the size of 
the required adjustment is what we attempt to 
approximate with our methodology.

Second, our sources of data, while robust, 
have limitations. In some instances, different 
sources do not agree, and some gaps in the 
data require interpolation. In some cases, 
data sources are themselves estimating 
quantities with a high degree of uncertainty. 
Even the UN population scenarios, while the 
closest assessments available to a global 
consensus view, have their critics (see 
sidebar “Predicting the future is hard, and 
demographers don’t agree”).

Dependency and depopulation?Sidebar: Predicting the future  
is hard, and demographers  
don’t agree

The complex interplay between fertility, 
life expectancy, migration, and existing 
population structures throughout the world 
not surprisingly creates uncertainty about 
how populations will evolve in the future. 
Many organizations forecast trajectories, 

which often vary widely. The projections in 
this report are based on the UN medium 
scenario from 2024.1 The United Nations is 
keenly aware of the inherent uncertainty in 
its calculations: its low and high scenarios for 
global population in 2100 differ by a factor 
of two, ranging from seven billion humans to 
14 billion humans (Exhibit A). 

Other well-established research centers 
such as the Institute for Health Metrics and 

Evaluation and the International Institute for 
Applied Systems Analysis use alternative 
methodologies to estimate population 
projections, with marginally different results. 
While the UN medium scenario is the 
closest thing to a global consensus view, it 
is not without its critics. For instance, some 
contend that it is too optimistic in its forecast 
that fertility rates will stop falling and slightly 
rebound in many countries (Exhibit B).2

don’t agree (continued)

Another important variable that UN 
projections cannot account for is changes 
to migration patterns. While fertility  

and longevity move slowly, migration  
can change suddenly due to changing 
economic conditions, conflict, or climate, 
among other factors, causing large  
swings in the evolution and location of 
populations that are extremely hard  
to predict. 

All in all, we are confident that the direction 
of our insights is correct, useful, and relevant 
to policy makers, businesses, and individuals. 
At the same time, it is important to note that 
specific numbers quoted in this research may 
not reflect exactly how the future will unfold, 
and so the report should be read as a scenario 
to prepare for rather than a prediction.

Working-age populations will peak and fall in three waves
Working-age people account for the bulk of economic output, so their numbers relative to those of 
older and younger people determine a host of economic outcomes. All regions will see the share of 
working-age people in their populations decline, although at different paces and points in time. First 
wave regions are those already undergoing this change. Later wave regions, where the shift is just 
beginning to take hold or hasn’t yet arrived, will experience a peak and subsequent decline in the 
share of working-age population in the future—in some cases, the near future. 

13

Dependency and depopulation?Among first wave regions are predominantly developed economies—Advanced Asia, Central and 
Eastern Europe, North America, and Western Europe—and Greater China, which has lower GDP 
per capita than other first wave regions but shares their demographic characteristics.8 These 
regions have an average total fertility rate of 1.2 children per woman today, and 67 percent of their 
combined population is working age, down from a high of 70 percent in 2010 (Exhibit 4). In aggregate, 
this cohort is rapidly shrinking in these regions, where the share of the working-age population is 
projected to drop to about 59 percent by 2050. 

There are two later wave groups of regions. A second wave has just reached the shores of Emerging 
Asia, India, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa. Their total 
fertility rate is 2.2, and 67 percent of their population is working age today. This wave is still gathering 
momentum, however, and will peak in the 2030s in aggregate. 

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the average fertility rate is 4.4 today, and just 56 percent of the population is 
working age. This share will continue to grow, peaking at 66 percent well into the second half of the 
century, when the third wave of the demographic shift hits its shores.

The three waves mask variations, and regions, countries, counties, and cities within them are at 
different stages of the demographic shift. For example, in the first wave, Germany’s working-age 
population share peaked in 1986, while in the United States and China, it peaked in 2007 and 2010, 
respectively. China is projected to experience a sharper decline in its working-age population share 
in the future, given its lower fertility rate and lower migration. The United States and India measure 
fertility rates at a subnational level, providing examples of how birth rates vary even more within 
countries. (See sidebar “Fertility rates vary significantly across regions and within countries.”)

Dependency and depopulation?Sidebar: Fertility rates vary 
significantly across regions and 
within countries

Some large nations, such as the United 
States and India, monitor the total fertility 
rate at a subnational level, capturing this data 
by state (exhibit).

In the United States, the overall fertility 
rate is 1.66, according to the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. Rates vary 
by state: South Dakota has a fertility rate 
of 2.01, just slightly below the replacement 

level and comparable to that of Indonesia. 
Texas, the second-most-populous state, has 
a fertility rate of 1.84. By contrast, Vermont 
and Washington, DC, have fertility rates 
of 1.35 and 1.24, respectively, figures that 
are more comparable to those of Finland or 
Switzerland.

Fertility rates vary even more widely in India. 
While the national fertility rate stands at 1.98, 
below the replacement level, about a third 
of the population resides in states where 
fertility rates exceed replacement levels. 
Sikkim, the state with the lowest fertility, 

is at 1.05, according to the fifth National 
Family Health Survey. Conversely, Bihar has 
a fertility rate of 2.98, between Kenya and 
Botswana. Even within Indian states, fertility 
rates vary among populations, reflecting 
urban and rural differences. In Bihar, the 
urban fertility rate is 2.35, while the rural 
fertility rate is significantly higher, at 3.11. 
Thus, while fertility is a national issue for 
many countries, a subnational approach to 
addressing falling fertility rates may yield 
richer results.

Dependency and depopulation?Nevertheless, the broad momentum and peak of this population cohort in countries within each wave 
are similar, reflecting the horizons over which they will confront youth scarcity. For first wave regions, 
the declining share of working-age population is a relatively new development, and many companies, 
governments, and communities haven’t yet fully come to grips with the implications. Later wave 
regions, excluding Sub-Saharan Africa, still have time to prepare, but not much. 

Support ratios will continue to fall
As the world becomes youth scarce, the number of workers per senior will fall. To illustrate this, we 
focus on the support ratio—the number of people aged 15 to 64 years, or those of working age, 
relative to the number 65 years and older. 

Globally, the support ratio was 9.4 in 1997. Put differently, there were more than nine working-age 
people to support one older person (Exhibit 5).

people to support each senior. 

This trend is starker in first wave economies, where the support ratio is already 3.9 today, down from 
6.8 in 1997. The ratio is expected to fall to two working-age individuals for every person over 65 years 
by 2050. Among regions in the first wave, Advanced Asia, Greater China, and Western Europe will 
have the lowest support ratios by 2050; the ratio will fall fastest in Greater China.

In later wave regions, the support ratio will decline from 10.3 today to 5.7 by 2050. India, where it is 
9.8 today, offers a particularly stark example. In the country currently home to the world’s largest 
population, the trajectory of birth rates and life expectancy indicates its support ratio will be roughly 
half what it is today by 2050 and drop to 1.9—about the same as Japan today—by 2100.

First wave countries’ populations have already peaked 
The world reached its maximum number of annual births in 2012, when 146 million babies were born, 
and the global number of births will continue to slowly decline. According to the United Nations, the 
total number of people on Earth will peak in 2084, at just above ten billion, and start declining in the 
latter years of this century.

Total population in first wave regions, however, peaked in 2020. On the current trajectory, the 
population of these regions will fall from 2.8 billion today to 2.6 billion by 2050 and to 1.9 billion by 
2100 (Exhibit 6). Only 22 of the 55 countries in these regions will have more people in 2050 than 
today, and populations in most of those countries will decline thereafter.9 Already, more people 
die each year than are born in 37 countries in first wave regions. Today, 60 percent of the world’s 
population aged 65 and older resides in these regions. By contrast, only 22 percent of those younger 
than 15 years live there.

Populations across later wave regions are still increasing. The second wave’s total population 
will reach its maximum by 2071, going from four billion today to five billion at its peak. Sub-
Saharan Africa’s population will still be growing by the turn of the century and is projected to 
reach 3.5 billion by then, up from 1.3 billion today. (See sidebar “Predicting the future is hard, and 
demographers don’t agree.”)

The population balance will shift decisively to later wave countries
These dynamics mean that the planet’s population is shifting toward later wave regions. By 2050, a 
quarter of the global population will live in first wave regions, compared with 35 percent of the world’s 
people today. According to UN projections, these regions could be home to less than 20 percent of 
the global population by 2100 (Exhibit 7). 

Even though Sub-Saharan Africa’s fertility rate is falling fast, almost 300 of the world’s next thousand 
babies will be born there. Nigeria alone will become home to 57 of the next thousand—or five more 
than the 52 born across Central, Eastern, and Western Europe combined. Similarly, 172 of the next 
thousand babies the stork delivers will be in India, where the birth rate overall has dropped below 
replacement but where the current population of women of childbearing age is still high. 

By 2100, Sub-Saharan Africa will account for all of the net global population increase, doubling its 
current share to 34 percent.10 By contrast, Greater China’s share of the global population, today the 
second largest among the ten regions, will shrink by two-thirds, from 18 percent in 2023 to 6 percent 
by 2100. This would make Greater China’s population only 170 million larger than North America’s, 
according to UN estimates, compared with a difference of roughly one billion people today.

Labor markets are expected to shift accordingly to young and growing countries in later wave regions 
unless migration patterns change dramatically, a trend we explore in greater detail in subsequent 
chapters. By 2050, holding current hours worked per capita constant within each age group, later 
wave regions would account for more than two-thirds of all hours worked globally.

At that time, Sub-Saharan Africa alone could account for 18 percent of global hours worked, doubling 
its share of work hours today. The share of the world’s work done by Chinese workers, on the other 
hand, could drop to 18 percent by 2050 from 26 percent today, and every other first wave region’s 
share is set to shrink.11 This could create an opportunity for many later wave countries to progress 
economically. Opportunities span the entire tradeable economy—services as well as manufacturing.

At least for the next quarter century, countries in later wave regions will account for more than 
half of global consumption, too, due to fast-growing young populations and growing incomes. 
For example, World Data Lab projects that India and Emerging Asia will account for 30 percent of 
global consumption at purchasing-power parity (PPP), up from 12 percent in 1997. By comparison, 
Advanced Asia, North America, and Western Europe could account for just 30 percent of the world’s 
consumption then, down from 60 percent in 1997 (Exhibit 8).12

This shift has important implications for many businesses in first wave and later wave regions alike 
as they develop and scale products to serve growing markets. As income and consumption grow 
in later wave regions, local and multinational companies will need to determine how to best meet 
changing local tastes and adapt their products and services accordingly. Affordability may increase in 
importance as consumers in later wave regions present a bigger market opportunity for businesses. 
Navigating as a business may become more complex, as many later wave countries have more 
challenging legal and governance environments and are more conflict prone.13

Prospects of depopulation put the focus on fertility rates 
Over the longer term, countries in first wave regions may face the challenge of depopulation 
(Exhibit 9).14 Populations in 26 countries in these regions are on track to decline by a third or more by 
2100, while in countries including China, Poland, and South Korea, they are expected shrink by half 
or more. Projections suggest that some countries with fertility rates below replacement, including 
France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, will have continued population growth through 
2100 based on positive net migration. 

Smaller populations could affect many sectors of the economy as the number of children born 
dwindles. If a country had a constant fertility rate of 0.7, equivalent to South Korea’s rate today, it 
would have just 13 grandchildren per 100 grandparents two generations from now. Just imagine 
school systems needing to adjust to a precipitous drop in the number of students, resulting in 
closing schools and extended travel distances. Declining populations would also challenge debt 
sustainability and the social contract, not to mention the global geopolitical balance.  While some 
contend that smaller populations could reduce carbon emissions, MGI research has found that

sustained economic growth is essential to pay for the net-zero transition—and this may come into 
question if populations shrink. 

How different would first wave regions look in 2050 and 2100 if fertility rebounded? We developed 
what we call the “replacement floor hypothetical,” which assumes that countries with fertility 
rates below the replacement rate today achieve a replacement-level fertility rate of 2.1 births per 
woman starting in 2024 and for every subsequent year. While this outcome is highly unlikely, it is an 
informative way to think about an alternative future.

Changing fertility rates don’t have an immediate effect, although due to compounding, having 
more children today under any scenario would have a big impact over the longer term. Under the 
UN medium scenario, the global population would reach 9.6 billion by 2050, while it would climb to 
10.2 billion under our replacement floor hypothetical over the same period. By 2100, populations 
under the two scenarios would grow to 10.2 billion and 12.6 billion, respectively. In Advanced Asia, 
achieving our hypothetical would lead to a population of 247 million in 2100, more than 1.6 times the 
population expected under the UN medium scenario (Exhibit 10).

Support ratios would also remain significantly higher, although still lower compared with today. 
By 2100, support ratios in first wave regions would level out at about 2.2 people of working age 
per senior, compared with a ratio of 1.4 under the UN medium scenario. In Western Europe, for 
example, the support ratio would increase from a projected 1.7 under the UN scenario to 2.2 under 
our hypothetical.

Increasing fertility rates, which traditionally fall as national income and female labor force 
participation rates rise, can be challenging. There are no clear examples of countries successfully 
boosting their birth rates significantly, although many are trying. For instance, the South Korean 
government has underwritten postpartum care centers in an effort to make childbirth as trouble-
free as possible.15 Hungary offers one-time cash incentives to new parents and spends almost 
6 percent of its GDP on fertility and family programs overall.16 Several Western European countries 
have extended family leave policies; Norway, for instance, covers the incomes of new parents up to a 
maximum of 49 weeks set by its welfare system, and many Norwegian employers choose to cover any 
gap in income to maintain full salaries.17 Despite these efforts, none of these countries has managed 
to push fertility rates back to the replacement level, although each initiative offers insights about 
what does and does not work to influence fertility rates over the longer term.18 Research tracking 
these efforts suggests that, on their own, policies that have been implemented and evaluated in high-
income countries to date are unlikely to lead to substantial or sustained increases to the birth rate.19

Regardless, any children born over the next few decades will not enter the workforce right away. 
Thus, even as countries consider steps to address population decline in the long term, they need to 
adapt to demographic shifts over the next two decades—the die has already been cast.

2. A lower-growth, 
higher-dependency future 
in first wave regions

Many first wave economies face a virtually unprecedented depopulation challenge toward the 
end of the century, according to UN projections. More immediately, they face another challenge: 
increasing dependency that could depress economic growth over the next quarter century. As 
population pyramids become bottom-light and top-heavy, the well-being of a growing legion 
of older people and of society at large will depend on a stagnant or shrinking number of people 
who work, which will increase pressure on public finances. Youth scarcity could also modify 
consumption and savings patterns.

In this chapter, we begin by analyzing the consequences of the demographic shift on labor markets 
and on GDP per capita growth by 2050 in first wave regions (chapter 2.1). Our findings are not 
projections: we have taken an all-else-being-equal approach, keeping all variables constant except 
the demographic structures, or age mix, of economies.

A combination of three levers—higher labor intensity, more robust productivity growth, and shifts 
toward a younger age mix via higher fertility and effective migration—can offset the headwinds of the 
youth deficit (chapter 2.2). In many countries in first wave regions, however, no one of those levers 
alone can sustain past GDP per capita growth rates. 

We then examine what could happen to savings trends and public finances (chapter 2.3). Finally, we 
examine changes in labor and consumption patterns that businesses may face and consider how they 
can respond (chapter 2.4).

Dependency and depopulation?2.1

2.1. Demographic shifts, slower economic growth
People typically work less as they get older, so the shifting demographic trends we’ve mapped could 
slow economic growth. GDP per capita depends on the number of hours worked per person and 
how productive each hour of work is, or productivity. Hours worked, in turn, depend on how much 
individuals of each age work, or labor intensity, and the number of people in each age group, or the 
age mix. Thus, GDP per capita growth depends on productivity growth, shifts in the age mix, and 
growth in labor intensity among people in each age cohort.

Under current projections, a changing age mix—more older people and fewer working-age 
people—will result in slower growth in hours worked and thus reduce GDP per capita growth if left 
unaddressed. In this section, we analyze the consequences of this shifting age mix on the growth 
in hours worked per person. Throughout, we assume that labor intensity in each age group remains 
constant at 2023 levels (see sidebar “Our approach to sizing the impact of demographic changes and 
how to counteract them”).

To maintain GDP per capita growth, countries will need to influence their age mix, increase labor 
intensity, or boost productivity growth—or, more likely, rely on a combination of all three. In the 
following section, we analyze how much these three levers would need to be pulled in order to 
maintain GDP per capita growth at the same rate recorded over the past 25 years.

25

Dependency and depopulation?Sidebar: Our approach  
to sizing the impact of 
demographic changes and  
how to counteract them

GDP per capita growth depends on 
growth in productivity—the value of output 
produced per hour of work—and growth 
in hours worked per person. The latter, in 
turn, depends on labor intensity growth in 
each age group and changes in the age mix. 
Labor intensity is driven by the share of the 
population that seeks work (the labor force 
participation rate), the share of those who 
find employment, and the number of hours 
each worker works. The age mix depends on 
fertility rates, longevity, and migration flows. 
Productivity growth is driven by physical and 
human capital investments as well as the rate 
of innovation.

Take Western Europe as an example 
(exhibit). As more women and older people 
joined the labor force there, labor intensity 
grew by 0.4 percent on average annually 
from 1997 to 2023. However, as the region’s 

age pyramid skewed older, primarily due to 
falling fertility rates, the changing age mix 
reduced economic growth by 0.3 percent 
per year. Productivity grew by 0.8 percent 
per year. Combined, the three components 
brought overall GDP per capita growth to 
1 percent a year. 

As the number of older people whose labor 
intensity is low increases and middle-aged 
cohorts with high labor intensity shrink, the 
age mix will increasingly depress growth, 
absent changes. Thus, labor intensity or 
productivity will have to grow faster to 
maintain past GDP per capita growth, or the 
age mix will need to shift in ways that differ 
from current UN projections via changes in 
fertility rates or migration. 

We aim to answer two questions in the first 
two sections of chapter 2: 

1.  How much will the change in the age mix 
projected under the UN medium scenario 
decrease growth in hours worked per 
capita and thus GDP per capita growth 
(chapter 2.1)?

2.  What changes in productivity, labor 
intensity, or the age mix would be 
necessary to maintain past GDP per 
capita growth (chapter 2.2)?

In chapter 2.1, we size the impact of the age 
mix on the growth of hours per capita. We 
hold the other component that drives hours, 
labor intensity per age group, constant at 
2023 levels.

In chapter 2.2, we consider target GDP per 
capita growth, which is the average annual 
growth in a country or region over the past 
25 years, and size the changes needed in 
productivity growth and labor intensity to 
maintain that growth, given the drag of the 
baseline age mix calculated in chapter 2.1. In 
only two countries does the target we use 
differ from their average 1997–2023 GDP 
per capita growth: China and South Korea. 
In 1997, these countries were emerging 
economies, so targeting their high past 
growth would be unrealistic. Instead, we 
calculated new targets for them based on 
the growth trajectory of economies that 
developed earlier. The GDP per capita

growth target for China is 4.9 percent per 
year, while that of South Korea is 2.0 percent.

Many combinations of labor intensity and 
productivity growth could result in the same 
GDP per capita growth, so we show two of 
these combinations: the required increase 

in labor intensity if past productivity growth 
remains constant, and the required annual 
productivity growth if past hours per capita 
growth remains constant.

Returning to the example of Western Europe, 
average GDP per capita growth in the past 
quarter century was 1 percent per year, which 
we use as the target for future growth. The 
region’s age mix will drag growth down by 
0.4 percent a year. Holding past productivity 
growth constant at 0.8 percent, labor 
intensity would need to grow by 0.6 percent 

annually to meet the GDP per capita growth 
target. By contrast, holding hours per capita 
growth constant at 0.2 percent, future 
productivity needs to grow by 1.2 percent 
annually to meet the target. 

Additional migration changes the age mix 
and thus affects average weekly hours 
worked per capita, so we separately 
calculate how many additional migrants 
would be needed to reach the required 
increase in hours, assuming past 
productivity growth stays constant. 

Labor intensity declines at older ages—before official retirement 
Labor intensity, measured as weekly hours worked per person in an age group, starts declining 
everywhere before official retirement ages. Across first wave regions, weekly hours worked per 
capita peak at about 50 years of age and decline thereafter (Exhibit 11). The primary reason is falling 
labor force participation rates—fewer older people continue to work—but on average, older workers 
who are employed also work fewer hours.  

In Germany, for instance, people aged 25 to 54 years work 25 hours per capita a week, on average, 
while those aged 55 to 64 years work 21 hours a week.20 Among Germans who are 65 years and 
older, this plummets to an average of two hours per capita per week—that is, two hours per person, 
including those who aren’t in the labor force. The rapid decline of hours per capita reflects two trends: 
lower participation in the labor force and less intensity among those who do work—but the net effect 
is what matters for an economy. 

Japan, a society with more older people, has more older workers, but labor intensity there still 
declines with age: Japanese between 25 and 64 years work 30 hours on average, and those 65 years 
and older work seven hours (see sidebar “Learning from Japan”).

Dependency and depopulation?Sidebar: Learning from Japan

Countries within waves are not all aging 
at the same pace. Japan’s fertility rate fell 
earlier than the rates of its first wave peers, 
and its average life expectancy at birth is 
the highest in the world at 84 years. In 2005, 
20 percent of its population was 65 years 
and older, and today that age cohort makes 
up 30 percent of the Japanese population.   

Projections suggest that the United States 
will be as old as Japan is today after 2100. 
France could reach this milestone in 2079, 
China in 2047, and Spain in 2037. This makes 
Japan an interesting case study and raises 

the question: What can other first wave 
countries learn from Japan?

The first lesson is that as support ratios 
decline, labor intensity must rise—fewer 
working-age people means that, all else 
being equal, others may need to work more 
to sustain economic growth. Japan’s labor 
intensity is higher than that of virtually all 
other developed countries, and even more 
so at older ages (exhibit). The labor force 
participation rate among Japanese aged 50 
to 65 years is 84 percent, up from 73 percent 
in 1997. Among people 65 years and older, it 
is 26 percent, compared with 19 percent in 
the United States and 4 percent in France.   

The second lesson Japan offers is that 
higher labor intensity alone may not be 
enough. Japan’s annual labor productivity 
has grown 1.1 percent per year, on average, 
since 1997, faster than the 0.8 percent 
increase in Western Europe and somewhat 
less than the 1.5 percent growth in the 
United States. Yet Japan’s GDP per capita 
has grown just 0.6 percent, compared with 
1 percent in Western Europe and 1.4 percent 
in the United States.1 The demographic drag 
is inexorable and severe, and when it hits, 
boosting productivity growth becomes even 
more relevant.

Dependency and depopulation?Fewer hours worked will depress economic growth
Because labor intensity declines with age, a future with fewer young and middle-aged people and 
more older people will mean lower growth in hours per capita per week, or labor intensity, all else 
being equal. From 1997 to 2023, the cohort aged 65 years and older was the fastest-growing age 
group in every first wave region. But the number of working-age people also increased in many first 
wave countries. The number of children younger than 15 years fell, a reflection of declining fertility 
rates. This combination helped partially balance the age mix for a while, diminishing the impact of 
increasingly aged populations. However, over the coming 25 years, the number of older people living 
in first wave regions will continue to grow while every other age cohort shrinks. This shift in the age 
mix could slow the growth in hours worked per capita across first wave regions by 2.2 hours per 
capita per week on average, thus slowing GDP per capita growth (Exhibit 12).

Dependency and depopulation?From 1997 to 2023, the age mix effect was neutral or slightly negative across first wave regions, 
dragging down hours of work per capita by a negligible amount. Over the next quarter century, 
the age mix will slow the growth in hours per capita per week—and thus GDP per capita growth—
by 0.4 percent annually in every first wave region other than North America (Exhibit 13). This is 
equivalent to a cumulative reduction in hours per capita per week of 2.2 hours across first wave 
economies from 2023 to 2050, ranging from 0.8 to 2.6 in different regions. A 0.4 percent drag on 
GDP per capita growth per year may seem trifling, but it isn’t. The shift in age mix could slow GDP 
per capita growth over the next quarter century, for example, by an average of $10,000 in Western 
Europe and $6,000 in Greater China.

Dependency and depopulation?Naturally, regional averages hide country variation. For instance, the effect of the demographic shift 
is already apparent in Australia, where a changing age mix has decreased weekly hours and GDP per 
capita growth by an average 0.2 percent per year over the past quarter century, a decrease forecast 
to continue at the same pace to 2050. Spain offers a particularly extreme example of the age mix 
effect. While it was neutral from 1997 to 2023, age mix could deduct 2.8 hours per capita per week, or 
0.8 percent of annual GDP per capita growth to 2050.

More women and older people working—and productivity—have supported past growth
Before turning to changes needed in future labor intensity and productivity growth if GDP per capita 
is to be maintained, it is worth asking how they have evolved in the past.

Aggregate labor intensity increased in Western Europe from 1997 to 2023 and declined in Greater 
China and Advanced Asia (Exhibit 14). It remained flat on average in North America and Central and 
Eastern Europe. 

But the labor intensity of two groups—women and older people—grew consistently in almost 
every region. 

Those 50 years and older increased their participation in labor markets everywhere. This effect 
was most pronounced in Europe but apparent in every region, even in Advanced Asia, where labor 
intensity overall declined. Second, women aged 25 and older—particularly older women—worked 
more. This was true in every region except Greater China, where women’s labor intensity did not 
change. In Advanced Asia overall, labor intensity grew, though it fell slightly among women aged 35 to 
50 years. 

Despite increased labor intensity among those older than 50 years and women in most first wave 
regions over the past quarter century, most regions had stagnant or falling aggregate labor intensity, 
largely because fewer people younger than 29 years worked. Western Europe was the only first wave 
region where overall labor intensity not only increased but more than completely offset the negative 
impact of the changing age mix.

Dependency and depopulation?Spain once again offers an interesting and extreme example of the impact of labor intensity on 
economic growth. Overall, weekly hours per capita there grew by an average 0.5 percent per year 
from 1997 to 2023, boosting GDP per capita growth by the same amount. The age mix shift did not 
add to or subtract from growth, meaning all additional hours worked were the result of increased 
labor intensity. But Spain, like other countries, not only will see a growing drag from the age mix, but 
may also struggle to sustain the very high growth in labor intensity of the recent past. Over the past 
quarter century, labor force participation among working-age females in Spain jumped from 60 to 
81 percent, an unrepeatable acceleration. Additionally, weekly hours per Spanish worker—those 
already in the workforce—have trended down for decades, and the country is currently discussing 
reducing the working week from 40 to 37.5 hours.21

Productivity growth is the other lever underpinning GDP per capita growth, and generally the most 
important one. Across first wave economies, it has been the largest contributor to growth over the 
past quarter century (Exhibit 15).

With demographics dragging down future GDP per capita growth, labor intensity, productivity, or the 
age mix will need to shift. By how much is the question we turn to next.

Dependency and depopulation?2.2

2.2. More workers, more hours, and more productivity needed
A growing youth deficit has already set first wave regions on a trajectory for declining hours of work 
per person and thus slower GDP per capita growth through 2050 compared with the past quarter 
century. Maintaining past economic progress, let alone increasing it, will require measures to address 
the impact of demographic headwinds. In this section, we explore the three levers available—labor 
intensity, productivity, and age mix—to neutralize the drag on economic growth caused by shifting 
age mix. The third lever, influencing the age mix by increasing the number of working-age people, can 
be pulled via migration and higher fertility. However, the impact of higher fertility rates by 2050 would 
be negligible, as a baby born today would be barely joining the workforce. So we only analyze the 
impact of migration here.

The conclusion is clear: pulling on only one of these three levers will be insufficient to achieve this goal 
in most countries, so using some combination of all three will be needed to maintain growth and raise 
living standards (Exhibit 16).

Note: Beyond migration, increasing fertility rates can shift the age mix and have positive effects on GDP per capita in the long run, but 2050 is too early to see 
the impacts.
1Assuming the same productivity growth as 1997–2023 continues. China and South Korea were less developed in 1997 and had very high productivity growth in 
the last quarter century; assuming constant productivity growth from the past would be unreasonable. For China, we assume productivity grows by 4.9%, in line 
with high-growth countries in the past, when they were at a similar development stage. For South Korea, we take the highest productivity growth across 
advanced economies in the last quarter century, 2.0%.

3Historical averages based on 2015–2019 (prepandemic) annual averages. Where available, historical numbers are cited from national statistics agencies 
(Australia, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom). United Nations estimates are used for the remaining countries (China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, US). 
Future migration required is calculated as the number of additional migrants required to maintain past growth if productivity growth remains constant.
4While “maintaining past GDP per capita growth” is a reasonable target for highly developed economies, China and South Korea were not as developed in 1997. 
Therefore, their GDP per capita growth targets are reduced, based on the trajectories followed in the past by other countries when they were at similar stages 
of development. China’s target is 4.9% per year, while South Korea’s is 2.0%.
5Historically, emigration has exceeded immigration in China, so needed migration cannot be expressed as a multiple of past migration.

To size the degree to which each lever must be pulled to sustain GDP per capita growth, we continue 
to rely on the all-else-being-equal approach we used for the analysis in the preceding section. We 
consider a target GDP per capita growth rate for each country equal to its annual growth over the 
past 25 years in all countries other than China and South Korea. In those countries, we lowered the 
target, since replicating their past growth would be an unrealistically high goal given their much more 
advanced level of development today (see sidebar “Our approach to sizing the impact of demographic 
changes and how to counteract them”).22

While the levers will likely need to be deployed in combination, each country can opt for a different 
“menu” of combinations, depending on its characteristics, opportunities, and challenges.

36

Dependency and depopulation?  
 
Both labor intensity and productivity must rise 
The first lever, increasing labor intensity, will be key. We analyze the overall increase in labor 
intensity needed to maintain past GDP per capita growth as well as what it would take if the full 
lift were accomplished by just one of three population groups alone: males under 50 years of age, 
or “younger men”; females less than 50 years old, or “younger women”; and people older than 
50 years, or “older people.”

Consider Germany, where GDP per capita grew an average of 1.1 percent per year over the past 
quarter century. Productivity growth over that period was 0.9 percent annually. Changes in the 
German age mix going forward are expected to reduce that growth by 0.4 percentage point. This 
means the country will need to fill a gap in GDP per capita of 0.6 percentage point per year if past 
productivity growth is to persist, which translates into an overall increase in labor intensity of 
2.2 more hours of work per capita per week, or 5.1 hours per worker. For any of the three cohorts—
younger men, younger women, or older people—to achieve that on their own, weekly hours per capita 
would need to expand by 12.7 hours, 13.2 hours, and 6.1 hours, respectively by 2050 (Exhibit 17). 

Hours per capita can in turn be increased in two ways: more people working—higher labor force 
participation—or more hours worked per worker in the labor force. While the latter is a possibility, 
recent trends in hours worked have gone in the opposite direction: German workers today work

week, which would further reduce labor intensity.23 Raising weekly hours worked by some groups, for 
example older people, may be feasible. Yet relying on only one cohort is challenging: if considering 
only existing workers, workers aged 50 to 79 would need to increase their weekly hours by 17.9 hours 
each, from an average of 27.0 hours today to 44.9 hours, to sustain past GDP per capita growth 
absent other changes.

Germany could also increase labor force participation, but the country already has one of the highest 
labor force participation rates in the world, at 90 percent among younger men and 81 percent of 
younger women. In fact, if the country were to rely solely on increasing labor force participation 
among these two cohorts to maintain past GDP per capita growth, younger workers’ labor force 
participation would need to exceed 100 percent, which is impossible. Germany could raise the 
participation of older people, which today is at 45 percent. However, the increase needed would be 
large, 18 percentage points. 

The German example illustrates how increasing labor intensity growth, while necessary, is unlikely 
to do the job of maintaining GDP per capita growth on its own. Some countries, such as Australia, 
the United Kingdom, and the United States, have a somewhat easier task, given their more favorable 
demographic prospects (Exhibit 18). Others, like China, Italy, South Korea, and Spain, have an even 
harder task than Germany. And keep in mind that this analysis depends on two important underlying 
assumptions. First, it assumes productivity growth continues to increase at the same rate, on average,

Dependency and depopulation?as it did over the past 25 years. In a scenario with lower productivity growth, the growth in labor 
intensity needed would be even bigger, whereas if productivity growth increases, it would be smaller. 

Second, the target for each country is equal to its past GDP per capita growth, which in many cases is 
not high. Italy’s target, for example, is a mere 0.4 percent annual growth. Should Italy want to achieve 
a healthier GDP per capita growth of, say, 1.5 percent, similar to that of the United States or Australia, 
the growth in hours per capita required would jump from 2.7 to a whopping 7.9, assuming constant 
past productivity growth of 0.3 percent per year. 

Given the big, and in some cases unfeasible, requirements for increased labor intensity, countries 
also need to find ways to propel productivity growth, the second key lever. Assuming hours worked 
per capita grow at the same rate as in the past quarter century, productivity in most first wave 
countries would need to grow between 1 and 2 percent a year to maintain past GDP per capita growth 
(Exhibit 19). That level of increase may seem modest, but in Germany, for example, it means doubling 
the past decade’s average rate of annual productivity growth of 0.7 percent. In Spain, productivity 
growth needs to increase by about four times, even assuming labor intensity grows at past rates. If 
labor intensity does not increase—a plausible scenario—productivity in Germany and Spain would 
need to grow by 1.5 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, per year.

02.01.00.51.501.00.51.50681042Dependency and depopulation?While productivity can grow by raising capital investment and harnessing digital and automation 
technologies, most first wave countries have long struggled to do so.24 In fact, productivity growth 
has slowed in many of those countries over the past decade. For instance, US productivity over 
the past decade grew 0.8 percent per year on average, much less than its earlier annual growth of 
2.0 percent. 

From the beginning of 2023 through the second quarter of 2024, productivity growth spiked in 
the United States to top 2 percent per year, while it flatlined in many Western European countries 
and Australia. This suggests that the United States may be better positioned to jump-start growth, 
although that remains an open question. The future holds opportunities and risks for productivity 
growth everywhere. For example, while AI promises to propel productivity, increasingly fragmented 
global value chains and the growth of traditionally low-productivity service sectors like healthcare 
due to increasing longevity could restrain productivity growth.25

China faces a special challenge. It is a first wave country because of its current demographic 
profile, but its GDP per capita of $21,000 (after adjusting for purchasing power) is closer to that 
of later wave regions. The country’s population is aging faster than almost anywhere else on Earth 
due to its low and declining fertility rate. To achieve a 4.9 percent growth target, China would 
need to grow its productivity by 5.5 percent a year, on average, through 2050 to counteract the 
demographic shift. This target is challenging, though not unattainable. While Chinese annual 
productivity growth over the past quarter century has been impressive, above 8 percent, it has 
slowed down more recently. Since the pandemic and through 2023, Chinese productivity grew 
by 5.2 percent annually.26 As the country develops further, maintaining such very high rates of 
productivity growth will not be an easy feat.

All in all, relying on either of these levers, labor intensity and productivity growth, to offset the impact 
of the demographic shift on its own is unlikely to do the job. Fortunately, countries can use them in 
combination (Exhibit 20). The possible combinations of hours and productivity growth needed to 
maintain GDP per capita growth vary by country. For example, Germany could achieve past growth 
by increasing productivity at 0.9 percent per year while also increasing hours of work per capita by 
2.2 or, alternatively, by growing productivity at 1.4 percent and hours of work per capita by 0.5 hour.

It could also attain past growth with a middle point of productivity and hours between these two 
outcomes, for example productivity growth of 1.1 percent and an additional 1.6 weekly hours per 
capita (see sidebar “‘Isoquants’ help plot the many potential paths to sustaining growth”). What is 
clear is that most countries in the first wave will likely need to rely on both.

An “isoquant” is an economic concept 
that describes different combinations of 
inputs—in this case, productivity growth 
and increased labor intensity—that result 
in a given level of output; here, GDP per 
capita growth. 

Take Spain as an example (exhibit). Given 
the impact of the demographic shift 
there through 2050, if labor intensity and 
productivity growth stayed the same, GDP 
per capita would grow 0.2 percent per 
year on average, significantly less than the 
country’s average annual past GDP per 
capita growth of 1.1 percent.

If Spain maintained its past growth in hours 
worked, or 1.5 extra hours of work per person 

per week, productivity would need to grow by 
1.4 percent a year. By contrast, if productivity 
growth remained stable at 0.6 percent a 
year, Spaniards would need to add 4.7 hours 
per week per capita to their current labor 
intensity levels. In fact, if Spain were unable 
to replicate the same labor intensity growth 
as in the past, which is not unlikely, the 
productivity growth needed to offset the 
demographic drag would exceed 1.4 percent 
and reach 1.9 percent.

The third lever to counteract the coming demographic drag is to influence the age mix itself, shifting 
the path already projected by the United Nations. This would require changes in fertility rates or 
migration patterns.

While increasing fertility rates is critical for population growth over the long term, babies born today 
will barely have entered the labor market by 2050, reducing the potential impact of higher fertility 
rates over much of the next quarter century.27 Migration can more immediately help countries grow 
their working-age population. However, the increase in migration needed to maintain GDP per capita 
growth is significant.

For example, the United Kingdom’s historical net migration is about 270,000 individuals per year, or 
0.4 percent of its 2023 population annually, on average.28 Holding past productivity growth constant, 
sustaining the country’s past GDP per capita growth rate would require an average additional 
140,000 migrant workers annually assuming that all migrants work, which would mean increasing 
the country’s population by 0.6 percent per year through 2050. But not all migrants work, at least 
right away, which increases the number of people of working age but does not necessarily boost 
GDP. Assuming that the share of new migrants to the United Kingdom participating in the workforce 
is the same as in the past, or 80 percent, then the annual flow of migrants needed to maintain GDP 
per capita growth in the United Kingdom at past levels would need to be an additional 185,000 above 
historical levels, or a total of 0.7 percent of the current population annually.29 Migrants also come with 
relatives who may not work—for example, children—so the real number needed would be even larger.

Other metrics illustrate the scale of migration required to maintain the economic status quo. For 
instance, new research estimates that if advanced economies relied on migration alone to maintain 
support ratios at today’s levels, in many cases as much as half of their populations would be foreign 
born by 2050, assuming each migrant brings one dependent.30

43

Dependency and depopulation?2.3

2.3. A growing societal bill for dependency
Older people consume more than younger people, directly through purchases and indirectly via 
in-kind transfers such as government-financed healthcare services, even as their income from 
working decreases and eventually disappears at retirement. This creates an imbalance between 
total consumption and labor income earned by seniors within a given year; we call this difference the 
senior gap.31

This gap requires funding via public or private means. In first wave regions, the largest source of 
funding comes from governments taxing workers over their careers and making transfers in the form 
of pensions and in-kind services like healthcare to seniors. Additionally, some older households 
finance part of their consumption by spending savings that they accumulated while working.

As numbers of older people grow, all else being equal, aggregate senior gaps will widen. To 
date, increasing public transfers, mostly pensions, and rising asset prices have funded growing 
consumption among seniors. Whether and for how long these sources are sustainable as life 
expectancy extends remains an open question. Pension systems in first wave economies, especially 
those with defined-benefit programs, are already stretched. If returns on assets decline or public 
finances can’t stretch any further, the only way to avoid savings depletion or falling consumption 
among seniors is some combination of the levers previously described—increased labor intensity and 
higher productivity growth over the short haul and effective migration and accelerated fertility rates 
in the longer term. 

Older people consume marginally more than younger people
Our analysis of consumption encompasses out-of-pocket spending by households and individuals, 
which we refer to as direct consumption, and, when data is available, in-kind services paid from the 
public purse. Such transfers are often an important share of consumption, especially in first wave 
economies with generous public education and healthcare programs. For example, the average 
German receives $8,000 in public in-kind transfers a year, in addition to $30,000 they spend on 
direct consumption.32

In most first wave regions, older individuals consume marginally more even as they earn less.33 In 
places where this isn’t true, consumption doesn’t fall substantially as people age. Both direct and 
in-kind consumption grow with age. In 2023, those 65 years and older had the highest consumption 
per capita in most first wave regions (Exhibit 21). Compared with overall average direct consumption 
by all age groups, this cohort spent 16 percent more per capita annually in both Western Europe and 
Advanced Asia. When measuring direct and in-kind consumption together, the discrepancy is even 
larger: seniors “spent” 24 percent more per capita a year in Western Europe and 22 percent more in 
Advanced Asia.

The aggregate senior gap will grow 
Labor income and consumption change across a life cycle. Children are dependent on their families. 
When they reach adulthood, they join the workforce and generate income that may exceed their 
consumption needs, allowing them to save and accumulate wealth. At retirement, labor income 
decreases but consumption does not, creating a deficit—the senior gap.34 In the United States, when 
direct and in-kind consumption were combined, the gap equaled $60,000 on average per person 
65 years and older in 2023 (Exhibit 22).

As the share of older people rises, all else being equal, aggregate gaps will widen considerably by 
2050.35 To compare the burden over time, we divide the aggregate gap by the total labor income of 
each region. Take North America, where it was 26 percent in 2023 (Exhibit 23). This means that the 
total consumption of seniors not funded by their own labor income was equivalent to 26 percent of 
all labor income in the country. Seen another way, this is the equivalent of a flat tax that, if imposed on 
all worker incomes, would be required to cover the total senior gap. As the shift in age mix intensifies, 
North America’s gap will rise to 34 percent by 2050 and go from 33 percent to 46 percent in Western 
Europe and from 33 percent to 48 percent in Advanced Asia.

The size of the gap may vary between countries based on consumer preferences. For example, 
consumers in one economy may choose to save more during their working lives and consume 
more in retirement, while those in another may choose to save less and consume less in retirement. 
Regardless of the gap’s absolute size, it will rise across all first wave economies.

Individual seniors fund retirement in many ways: by saving directly during working years, by  
earning returns on assets, through public pensions, transfers and subsidized in-kind services, 
and through familial care and private transfers. In recent years in advanced economies, two of 
these sources—public pensions, mostly in the form of pay-as-you-go programs, and asset price 
appreciation, particularly in family homes, which has buoyed accumulated savings—have been 
central to funding seniors’ consumption, but they may be increasingly hard to maintain for future 
generations of retirees.

Public pensions will put increasing pressure on government finances
Public transfers, primarily in the form of public pensions, cover more than half of the senior gap 
in many first wave countries. In the United States, Social Security covered about half of the 
senior gap in 2023, while in Spain and France, public pensions funded close to 80 percent of it 
(Exhibit 24).36 Other government programs, including in-kind government transfers, fund between 
15 and 30 percent of senior gaps, depending on the country. Private sources such as returns on 
assets filled in the remainder.

100% of senior gap

As support ratios—the number of working-age individuals for every person 65 years and older—fall 
fast, first wave countries will grapple with the question of whether public pensions and other age-
related public transfers are sustainable. In most advanced economies, public pensions have pay-
as-you-go systems that are funded by taxes on current workers. In addition, seniors often receive 
a range of in-kind benefits, which vary by country and individual but usually include healthcare and 
sometimes extend to housing, utilities, nutrition, or transportation.

Since 1970, time spent in retirement has increased substantially, from eleven to 18 years, according 
to research by the OECD.37 As lives lengthen, getting the pension math to “add up” is increasingly 
challenging. Countries across the developed world have opened conversations on changes ranging 
from increasing the statutory retirement age to switching to defined-contribution systems, in 
which retirement benefits are calculated based on the money paid into the program (see sidebar 
“Pension tensions: Sense on the dollar?”). Absent changes, increasing numbers of seniors will cause 
government deficits and debts to continue rising.

Dependency and depopulation? 
Sidebar: Pension tensions:  
Sense on the dollar?

More than 2,000 years ago, the fall of  
the Roman republic was inextricably  
linked to the payment, or rather the 
nonpayment, of military pensions. During 
the American Revolution, army pensions 
became such a sensitive issue that only the 
intervention of George Washington himself 
prevented a mutiny of Continental Army 
troops over delays in the payment of their 
promised pensions.1

Today, almost all advanced economies have 
some form of pension system, although the 
comprehensiveness of these systems varies 
widely and their future is uncertain. 

Modern pension systems take the following 
three main forms, and most developed 
countries have more than one form, or a 
multi-pillar pension system: 

 — Pay-as-you-go systems: Most common 
in Western Europe, these systems pay 
retirees from contributions made by 
today’s workers.

 — Defined-contribution systems: Workers 

contribute to a retirement fund during 
their employment and receive payouts 
from it in retirement. Both the United 
Kingdom and China are shifting funding 
to defined-contribution systems from 
publicly funded pension systems. 

 — Personal savings: Workers save and 

invest their own money for retirement 
spending. Sometimes this may be 
facilitated or encouraged by the 
government, for example through tax-
advantaged retirement savings vehicles. 

The US system features a blend of the three 
types. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go 
system; employer-sponsored 401(k) plans 
are a flavor of defined-contribution pension; 
and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) 
are a commonly used personal retirement 
savings tool. Seventy-three percent of 
civilian workers in the United States had 
access to some form of employee retirement 
benefits in 2023.2

Public pension systems around the world 
are under big strains due to slow economic 
growth, inadequate contribution rates, and 
increasing longevity, as seniors spend more 
time in retirement. For example, in the OECD, 
men are spending 18 years in retirement and 
women 23 years, compared with 11 and 15 
years, respectively, in the early 1970s. 

The global gap between retirement 
savings and the amount of savings needed 
to replace 70 percent of preretirement 
income for retirees was projected in a 2019 
World Economic Forum report to exceed 
$400 trillion by 2050, more than five times 
the size of the global economy.3 The report 
projected that 25 percent of that gap could 
stem from unfunded government pension 
obligations. In the United States, the fund 
that supports Social Security benefits could 
be depleted by 2034, at which point benefits 
could be reduced by about 25 percent unless 
action is taken to shore up the system.4

For many years, the retirement paradigm 
was that one worked into their mid-60s and 
then lived off pensions and other savings for 
just a few years before dying. Traditionally, 
lower life expectancies meant the average 
person could only expect to live a few years 
in retirement. As countries grapple with 

looming issues, that paradigm may need to 
shift, and countries are experimenting with 
different ways. 

Many first wave countries have adjusted 
funding strategies or moved from a defined-
benefit to a defined-contribution system. 
For example, the Netherlands passed a 
systemic reform of private pensions that 
included that switch. 

Other countries are raising the retirement 
age. Current retirement ages are set to 
increase in three-fifths of OECD countries. In 
China, a 1950s-era system that allowed men 
to retire at 60 years and women between 
50 and 55 years was recently overhauled, 
increasing the retirement age for men to 63 
years and for women to 58 years.5 Sweden 
raised the retirement age and will link it to 
two-thirds of life expectancy gains. France 
has tightened early and minimum retirement 
ages. The age requirements for pension 
eligibility range from 62 years in Colombia, 
Luxembourg, and Slovenia to 70 years or 
more in Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands.6

Still others are focusing on mandating 
and facilitating private savings. Australia’s 
retirement system relies on mandatory 
private savings via superannuation, requiring 
employers to contribute 9 percent of wages. 
Some independent entities project that 
workers will retire with two to three times the 
pension income they would have had under 
the public pension system in the future.7 And 
in the United States, the Internal Revenue 
Service recently increased the percentage 
of pretax income workers can contribute to 
IRAs each year.8

Dependency and depopulation?To illustrate this, we focus on three first wave economies: Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States; they publish reliable public statistics on government income and expenses by age and have 
widely accessible public pay-as-you-go pension systems.38 Governments in these economies collect 
most tax revenues from their working-age citizens and spend most of that revenue on the youngest 
and oldest. For example, in Spain in 2023, seniors contributed 12 percent of total tax revenues but 
consumed more than 40 percent of government spending, mostly in the form of pension payments 
and healthcare. On the flip side, Spaniards 36 to 45 years delivered 25 percent of all tax revenue 
and accounted for just 9 percent of government spending (Exhibit 25). This intergenerational social 
contract works so long as a balance between younger and older people is maintained. However, 
when that balance tips and there are too few workers to sustain the obligations that societies have to 
retirees, that social contract is strained.

Dependency and depopulation?Seniors are the largest group of net recipients of government expenditures. The difference between 
taxes paid and transfers received by the average senior ranges from $21,000 in the United States to 
$33,000 in Spain. This amounts to a total difference of more than $1.2 trillion in the United States and 
$325 billion in Spain annually.

Due to the age mix effect, deficits will increase as tax revenues fall and age-related expenditures 
increase, all else being equal (Exhibit 26). Keeping per capita tax revenue and public expenditures 
constant and applying the impact of the demographic shift, the overall per capita deficit would 
increase by 4.5 times in Spain in the next quarter century, from $1,700 to $7,900.39 In the United 
Kingdom, where the population 65 years and older will continue to grow but at a slower pace, the 
average gap could double, reaching $1,800.  

In the United States, the average gap will increase by 12 percent, all else being equal, since taxes will 
increase slightly as those 46 to 64 years old pay more tax on average than younger people. The US 
Congressional Budget Office’s annual deficit projections, which dynamically consider many more 
relevant variables, estimate that total deficits will grow from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2023 to 8.1 percent 
in 2050, with about a fifth of the increase explained by a changing age mix. This equates to a 16 percent 
increase per capita based on age mix alone, slightly higher than our 12 percent projection.40

These growing gaps come at a time when government finances are already strained. In numerous 
first wave countries, including France, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, 
public debts exceed 100 percent of annual GDP.41

Age-related public expenditures have accounted for much of the growth in public expenditures 
that exceed tax revenues. For example, healthcare expenditure in the United Kingdom increased 
3.2 percent on average annually from 1997 to 2021, while the country’s total expenditures grew an 
average of just 1.2 percent. Similarly, in the United States, spending on Social Security increased

annually by 2.4 percent on average across the same period, more than twice as fast as the average 
0.9 percent growth in total government expenditure.42 Over that period, tax revenue in the United 
Kingdom and the United States increased less than 1 percent on average per year.43

Asset appreciation, especially in real estate, has supported senior consumption—so far
Personal savings fund the balance of consumption in retirement not covered by government 
transfers. How these savings are accumulated depends on individual savings behavior and asset 
returns. Retirees in many advanced economies have accumulated wealth in recent decades, in large 
part thanks to rising asset prices, particularly for housing but also via equity markets.44 To understand 
the link between wealth and senior gaps, we focus on the United States, which has high-quality and 
granular data. 

Overall, wealth is unevenly distributed—across the US population, the top 1 percent of households 
hold 26 percent of the country’s wealth, while the bottom 50 percent hold 3 percent of it.45 As more 
people enter retirement, those without wealth will need to rely primarily on public pensions that are 
already strained.

In aggregate, though, older people are generally wealthier than younger people, which provides a 
kind of buffer for retirement. American households where the primary householder is 65 years and 
older held 43 percent of the country’s total wealth, although they made up only 20 percent of the US 
population in 2023 (Exhibit 27).46 The wealth held by older households grew by a factor of 6.6 from 
1997 to 2023.47 By contrast, among households with a primary householder 40 years and younger, 
wealth increased by a factor of 2.9 over the same period.48

Web < 2024>
<MGI-Demographics>

Dependency and depopulation? 
One big contributor to wealth in the United States has been real estate. Almost 80 percent of 
Americans 65 years and older are homeowners, and 60 percent of them are mortgage-free.49 Older 
homeowners in the United States typically don’t pay rent, which frees up resources to consume other 
goods and services. As we show in the following section, individual consumption of housing and 
utilities, including imputed rents, among those 65 years and older accounts for about 40 percent 
of total consumption, a sizable portion.50 Homeowners also have the option of moving to smaller, 
cheaper homes to free up equity. Research indicates that housing mobility among individuals 
55 years and older can be as high as 39 percent.51 Homes can be used as loan collateral, and more 
expensive homes allow for larger loans with better terms. Value from homeownership is sometimes 
hard to unlock—for example, selling a home is not always easy and has costs associated with it—but 
these options are nonetheless available to homeowners, who are disproportionately older. 

Other sources of private wealth have also had outsize returns in recent years. For example, returns 
from US stock markets averaged 10.8 percent annually after adjusting for inflation from 2013 to 
2023, significantly higher than the 50-year average of 6.4 percent from 1973 to 2023.52 A significant 
portion of 401(k) retirement assets benefit from these stock market returns for the 56 percent of US 
workers who have them.53

One question is whether future seniors will be able to fund consumption with earnings linked to 
accumulated wealth to the same extent that current seniors can. For instance, young savers may 
face challenges in buying a house, an asset that has increased markedly in price over the past two 
decades. The average US single-family home was 6.6 times more expensive in 2023 than in 1980.54 
Back then, the median home price was 4.4 times the median annual household income.55 In 2023, 
that ratio was 7.1 times and as high as 12.5 times in Los Angeles, California.56 Younger families 
buying homes may be left with a double burden of a higher mortgage and higher taxes to fund 
retirees. Younger people who eventually inherit homes may do so at older ages as their parents live 
longer. Additionally, there is no guarantee that home prices will keep rising in the face of declining 
populations. For example, Japan has experienced low real price appreciation in recent years, in 
part due to low population growth, especially in rural areas where housing prices fell faster as 
populations declined.57

Future generations may face obstacles to accumulating the same levels of private wealth as today’s 
seniors, and more of them will be retiring and living longer in their retirement. First wave countries 
will need to ensure the sustainability of public pension systems. Tweaking retirement ages will not 
be sufficient. In many countries, it will take raising labor intensity across different age groups and 
simultaneously increasing productivity, alongside migration and long-term increases in fertility. None 
of these are easy fixes, but in combination, they can offset the demographic drag, protect public 
finances, and boost human well-being and prosperity.

2.4. Older workers, older consumers
As demographic shifts change the composition of labor forces and consumption pools, businesses 
will find new opportunities and challenges. By 2050, the share of the population 65 years and 
older in first wave countries will rise to 29 percent, up from 17 percent today and 10 percent in 1997. 
Companies can revisit strategies and adapt mindsets to remain relevant. Those that understand how 
shifting demographics will affect their customers and employees and adapt accordingly will gain a 
competitive advantage in the rest of this century. 

Welcome the senior workforce  
One big consequence of the demographic shift in first wave regions is a likely increase in the share 
of older workers in the labor supply. An older workforce presents unique needs and challenges that 
organizations must address as well as skills and experiences they will want to harness to ensure 
continued productivity. With more older people in their workforces, businesses will need to adapt 
career planning, reorganize teams, encourage lifelong learning, and expand and adjust retraining 
programs. We examine what businesses and policy makers can do more fully in chapter 4. 

By 2050, if hours of work per capita for each age cohort are held constant and only the age mix 
shifts, people 65 years and older will contribute 6 percent of the total hours worked in first wave 
economies, up from 4 percent today. Among people 50 years and older, the trend is more stark: 
their share will climb to 37 percent on average by 2050, up from 32 percent today and 17 percent 
in 1997 (Exhibit 28).58 In China, for example, workers aged 50 and older will account for 39 hours 
of every 100 hours worked, up from 31 hours in 2023.59 For many economies in Advanced Asia and 
Europe, this trend began during the past 25 years, and their share of older workers will level off. For 
example, in Japan, people aged 50 and older account for 42 percent of hours worked today, up from 
32 percent in 1997, and that level is expected to stay relatively flat through 2050. However, if labor 
intensity among older people keeps growing, as it has in the past quarter century, their share of 
the workforce will increase even more. For example, if older Germans kept increasing their working 
hours as they did over the past quarter century, they would account for as much as 42 percent of the 
country’s labor force rather than 35 percent by 2050.

The share of consumption from seniors will grow 
As discussed in the previous section, consumption grows with age. Healthcare expenditures account 
for much of the higher spending by seniors, but even excluding it, per capita consumption goes 
up—or does not decline meaningfully—as people age. However, the effects of age shifts on overall 
consumption appear slowly.60

What may change more quickly is the share of consumption that seniors account for. Today, residents 
of first wave economies who are 65 years and older account for 21 percent of direct consumption, 
which is the share of consumption paid for by households, compared with 15 percent a quarter 
century ago. As countries become increasingly youth scarce, this share will increase to 31 percent by 
2050, assuming consumption per capita in each age group remains constant and only demographic 
patterns change (Exhibit 29). 

Some regions may see much more dramatic shifts. In China, for instance, those 65 years and older 
accounted for 14 percent of direct consumption in 2023, a share that could more than double by 
2050. In Advanced Asia, the share of direct consumption by older people could rise from 26 percent 
today to 39 percent over that period. In dollars and cents, that means $4 of every $10 of direct 
spending there may come out of the wallet or bank account of a senior.

Due to falling fertility rates, the share of consumption among those younger than 30 years will 
decrease from 26 percent in 2023 to 22 percent in first wave regions, including a fall of as much 
as eight percentage points in China. In most first wave countries, however, this declining share of 
young consumers is likely to be offset by rising incomes and thus not result in absolute decreases in 
consumption dollars through 2050. Consumers aged 45 to 65 years are likely to maintain a relatively 
flat share of total consumption through 2050.61

What is consumed will change: More health and wellness, less education spending
Global consumption is set to shift toward categories of goods and services consumed in greater 
quantities by those 65 years and older. At a category level, some of the biggest shifts will be in 
healthcare among older people and education among younger people. These categories are 
driven by in-kind consumption funded directly by governments. For example, an average individual 
in Germany spends just $1,000 annually on out-of-pocket healthcare consumption, an amount 
that increases to more than $8,000 when combined with in-kind transfers to capture all forms of 
health spending.62

To analyze overall consumption among categories across a life cycle, we focus on China, Germany, 
Japan, and the United States, where granular data exists for in-kind government expenditure, which 
we add to household expenditure. Not surprisingly, education consumption decreases sharply with 
age, going from a range of 20 to 40 percent of consumption for children up to 15 years old to less than 
1 percent for those 65 years and over. In absolute values, governments and individuals in the United 

57

Dependency and depopulation?States, for instance, spend an average of $7,000 on education annually for each child younger than 
15 years, whereas an individual over 65 years spends only $600 on average annually on education.63 
By contrast, seniors’ expenditure on healthcare, both directly and in kind, is significantly bigger than 
that of children. In the United States, healthcare consumption varies from $3,400 a year on average 
for those younger than 15 years to $11,600 a year for those older than 65.64 In China, it more than 
triples over a life cycle, from $800 to $2,600 (Exhibit 30).

Dependency and depopulation?Of course, there is some variation. For instance, American seniors spend significantly more on 
housing and utilities than their younger counterparts, a trend that is less pronounced in China, 
Germany, and Japan. In the clothing and footwear category, Chinese seniors spend significantly 
less than younger cohorts, but not in Germany, Japan, and the United States. For most categories 
of consumption, however, trends across a life cycle are broadly consistent in the four countries 
highlighted here.  

Given how consumption plays out over a life cycle, we can measure how shifting demographics could 
affect the size of different spending categories.65 In three of the four countries analyzed, healthcare 
will be the consumption category most increased by demographic shifts, with spending on healthcare 
per capita increasing between 5 and 29 percent as a result of changes in age mix alone. In Japan, 
the average person will spend 5 percent more on healthcare per year in 2050 compared with 2023, 
considering only the age mix shift. In the United States, per capita healthcare consumption could 
increase by 8 percent, or $380 billion in 2050, solely as a result of the shift in age mix. 

Conversely, education spending could shrink most due to the demographic shift in all four countries 
as falling fertility rates cause the number of young individuals to decline. Average yearly education 
consumption per capita could be 4 to 33 percent lower by 2050 due to age mix shifts, or as much as 
$465 billion less in China in aggregate by 2050 solely due to age mix (Exhibit 31).

Dependency and depopulation?Other factors, including population growth or decline and changes in per capita income, will also 
influence future consumption in these categories. Japan’s population is expected to shrink by 
15 percent by 2050, while that of the United States is projected to grow by 11 percent, which will 
cause market sizes to diverge in aggregate. In addition, our analysis suggests that more than 
80 percent of the increase in aggregate consumption has stemmed from rising per capita incomes 
over the past few decades and only very little from demographic effects. 

Including expected income and population effects, World Data Lab projects that US healthcare 
expenditures could grow by as much as $1.2 trillion by 2050. Despite negative population growth, 
overall consumption across all categories is expected to grow by 15 percent in Japan and to more 
than double in China by 2050 solely on the basis of income effects. Even in a category like clothing 
and footwear that will be negatively affected by the age mix effect, total consumption is projected to 
increase by 4 percent per year in the United States and 73 percent in China based on rising incomes.  

Businesses in first wave countries will need to learn and adapt to changing patterns among 
consumers and the workforce. These shifts are already under way in some places, which we explore 
in Chapter 4. Ultimately, if businesses can make these adjustments, they can not only improve their 
own competitive positioning but also contribute to counteracting the demographic drag and lift their 
workers’ and consumers’ living standards.

demographic shifts in 
later wave regions

The same demographic shift reducing the share of working-age people in first wave regions today 
is gathering force and will engulf many later wave economies in one to two generations. These 
regions—Emerging Asia, India, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, 
and Sub-Saharan Africa—have the benefit of some time to prepare for the consequences of changing 
population structures, though how much time each has before shifting demographics become a 
drag on GDP per capita varies widely. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the working-age share of 
the population won’t decline until sometime after 2080, while in Latin America, it will do so 50 years 
earlier, in the 2030s.

However, later wave regions overall face a challenge most first wave regions do not, namely the 
need to “get rich” before their populations “get old.” Today, most countries in first wave regions have 
attained high incomes and have high-quality infrastructure, extensive provision of public services, 
and high productivity. Over the next quarter century, most later wave economies will have first 
wave population structures but significantly lower GDP per capita. Their challenge is to increase 
wealth before their populations age. While Sub-Saharan Africa has more time, its GDP per capita is 
significantly lower than any other region’s, increasing the imperative to raise productivity faster than 
population growth.

Later wave regions can learn what to emulate—and what to avoid—from the experiences of first wave 
regions. These younger regions have the gift of time, though that, too, is limited. 

Later wave regions face the challenge of ‘getting rich’ before they ‘get old’ 
Many emerging economies have struggled to achieve per capita income and living standards that 
match those in rich countries, despite remarkable progress to reduce extreme poverty. According to 
the World Bank, more than 60 percent of the world’s population lived in low-income countries in the 
1990s, while today less than 10 percent do.66 Yet the share of people living in high-income countries 
has stubbornly remained less than one-fifth of the global population over that period.67

Meanwhile, the demographic clock is ticking for emerging economies. Fertility rates in one-third of 
the 138 countries in later wave regions are already below replacement. For example, India’s fertility 
rate is 1.98 and Türkiye’s 1.63. Fertility rates in Latin America and the Caribbean stand at 1.8 on 
average, and each of the region’s six biggest economies—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, 
and Peru—has a fertility rate below 2.0. By 2050, fertility rates will drop below the replacement rate 
in 32 more countries in later wave regions, according to UN projections. Only in Sub-Saharan Africa 
will the average fertility rate, 2.9, exceed the replacement rate of 2.1. 

As fertility rates fall, so subsequently will support ratios—the number of working-age people for every 
person over 65. These regions therefore have limited time before their population structures take the 
shape of those in first wave regions today, reaching their support ratios (Exhibit 32). They will need to 
accelerate their economic growth to get ahead of their demographic shift and attain living standards 
that can support seniors.

Achieving the high-income threshold of per capita GDP is a challenge for many developing countries. 
For example, Brazil’s GDP per capita is 73 percent of the World Bank threshold for high-income 
countries, and the country is expected to reach the average support ratio of first wave economies, 
3.9, in 16 years. Bangladesh has 35 years until it reaches that ratio, but its GDP per capita is just 
18 percent of the high-income threshold at present.

Sub-Saharan Africa has more time but also starts with lower GDP per capita. For example, GDP per 
capita in Ethiopia is roughly $1,200, or 9 percent of the high- income threshold, while in Nigeria, 
GDP per capita is $2,400, or roughly 17 percent of the threshold. Estimates of potential economic 
growth are notoriously uncertain, and even small deviations in economic growth compound over time. 
But existing projections suggest that more than two-thirds of later wave countries would not reach 
the high-income threshold before their support ratios fall to the current level in first wave regions 
(Exhibit 33).68 If all countries in later wave regions underperformed projections by just 1 percent a 
year, 80 percent of them would fail to achieve the high-income threshold before their populations 
were as aged as in first wave regions. If they fell short by 2 percent, 87 percent would not be high-
income by that time.

The demographic dividend will diminish in later wave regions, other  
than Sub-Saharan Africa, through 2050
Over the past quarter century, GDP per capita increased in most later wave regions as a result of 
increasing working-age populations as a share of total population, creating a demographic dividend. 
Yet in most regions, this dividend will diminish or disappear entirely by 2050. Only in Sub-Saharan 
Africa will the dividend increase over the next 25 years compared with the past quarter century. This 
will aid growth, provided countries in the region create incentives to invest in human and physical 
capital and infrastructure (Exhibit 34). 

Take India. The dividend added 0.7 percentage point each year on average to the country’s GDP per 
capita growth, but as the age mix skews older, it will contribute only 0.2 percent annually on average 
to Indian incomes to 2050. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the shifting age mix has added an 
average of 0.5 percent to GDP per capita over the past quarter century, but its contribution will fall 
to zero over the next 25 years. In Mexico, real GDP per capita will be $2,600 less in 2050 due to the 
changing age mix compared with what it would be were there no shift in age mix. Conversely, the 
demographic dividend will increase GDP per capita in Sub-Saharan Africa, which will gain an average 
of 0.7 percent annually to 2050, more than double the 0.3 percent annual rate of growth over the 
past 25 years.

Between 2023 and 2050, Sub-Saharan Africa will increase its working-age population by 
650 million. However, these new workers will boost GDP per capita growth and realize the benefits  
of the demographic dividend only if they can find good jobs. Today, many workers in the region 
hold low-wage, low-productivity jobs; in 2018, 90 percent of people living there were informally 
employed.69 More than half its population—and as much as 69 percent in Chad, for example—works 
in the low-productivity agriculture sector.70

65

Dependency and depopulation?Boosting productivity is key to raising living standards ahead of  
demographic shifts
The per capita GDP of an economy is determined by the size of its workforce relative to population 
and the productivity of each worker. Later wave economies have the opportunity to develop a 
“flywheel” effect in which productivity gains encourage investment that, in turn, spurs further 
productivity gains and so on. This leads to meaningful employment opportunities and boosts 
purchasing power, thus expanding opportunities for companies to invest in even more productive 
capacity. Absent such investment, workers in these emerging economies will struggle to find gainful 
work opportunities and accumulate the savings their economies need to finance retirement.

Since the first spin of the wheel depends on increased productivity, the biggest priority for countries 
in later wave regions is to boost productivity growth, converging with levels of high-income 
economies. The productivity gap today is large in later wave regions, ranging from $3 per hour in  
the bottom decile to a median of $13 per hour compared with $60 an hour in high-income countries. 
In fact, closing this gap is important for the world economy at large, given the profound implications  
it has for global productivity (see sidebar “Labor pools and global productivity”).

Countries with lower productivity levels can experience catch-up growth by creating conditions to raise 
investment and spurring innovation that generates higher initial returns on new capital (Exhibit 35).

Dependency and depopulation?Sidebar: Labor pools and  
global productivity

First wave regions are significantly more 
productive today than later wave regions. 
For example, productivity per hour worked is 
as high as $80 in North America and $73 in 
Western Europe, while India’s productivity 

per hour is $9 and Sub-Saharan Africa’s just 
$6. But later wave regions have the potential 
to improve productivity as their aggregate 
hourly contribution to global labor pools 
increases (exhibit).

If productivity per hour of work remains 
constant in all regions and working hours 

shift to later wave regions, as changing 
demographic structures suggest they will, 
total average global productivity would 
drop by 12 percent to 2050, or 0.5 percent 
a year on average. This underscores the 
importance of increasing productivity in 
later wave regions.

However, emerging economies have had mixed success in raising productivity. Over the past quarter 
century, some “fast-lane” economies narrowed their productivity gap rapidly.71 Yet at their current 
pace of productivity improvement, several “slow-lane” economies that are home to 1.4 billion people 
would never match advanced-economy levels. Then there are the additional 1.3 billion people living 
in “middle-lane” economies where productivity is growing only slightly faster than in advanced 
economies, meaning it would take them more than 100 years on average to converge. Unless these 
slow- and middle-lane economies accelerate their productivity growth, their populations will get old 
before becoming rich.

67

Dependency and depopulation?Fast-lane economies have made progress toward narrowing their productivity gap with advanced 
economies at a rapid pace. India’s annual productivity grew 5 percent on average over the past 
quarter century, while Cambodia’s and Bangladesh’s grew at about 4 percent. Productivity in middle-
lane countries, such as Egypt, Indonesia, and Kenya, has grown only slightly faster, about 2 percent 
on average, than in advanced economies. The opportunity is large. If Indonesia were to improve its 
productivity by $5 per hour worked, it would result in a 34 percent increase in GDP per capita.

The need to jump-start productivity growth is most pressing in Latin America and the Caribbean 
and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa’s annual productivity growth was 1.1 percent on 
average over the past quarter century, while Latin America’s grew by 0.9 percent. To be sure, there 
are countries within these regions that have increased productivity faster, such as the Dominican 
Republic and Rwanda, at 2.3 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. But most countries in these 
regions are in the slow lane. 

In addition to—and, in many ways, facilitated by—productivity growth, later wave regions have 
opportunities to boost labor intensity, in some cases reversing trends of the past. While the 
demographic dividend has increased GDP per capita over the past quarter century, changes in 
participation rates in these regions have offset some of those gains. For example, a changing age mix 
that increased the working-age population in India helped increase GDP per capita by 0.7 percent 
on average from 1997 to 2023. However, labor intensity fell by 1.1 percent over the same period, 
more than offsetting the positive impact of a bigger working-age cohort. This was in part because 
more younger people remained in school longer and attained more robust educations, a welcome 
development, but it also reflects stagnating labor force participation rates among women.  

Indeed, the female labor force participation rate in the median economy in later wave regions 
is 61 percent, or 19 percentage points less than in the median first wave country, although the 
rate varies widely, from 19 percent in Egypt to as high as 84 percent in Nigeria, according to the 
International Labour Organization. If India were to increase its female labor force by ten percentage 
points, it would increase its GDP per capita by 4 to 5 percent.

Even among people already in the labor force in late wave regions, unemployment, underemployment, 
and employment in informal or low-productivity activities are persistent problems. Raising capital 
investment and creating jobs in more productive sectors would create opportunities to engage labor 
forces in more gainful work. If Brazil increased its employment-to-population ratio by four percentage 
points, GDP per capita could increase by 8.7 percent, for instance. 

Later wave countries can capitalize on opportunities and sidestep  
foreseeable problems 
Businesses and governments in later wave countries can learn from the experiences and 
trajectories of first wave countries navigating the demographic shift today and leverage their 
comparative advantages. By doing so, they can boost productivity and GDP per capita and set 
a course to successfully navigate their own aging in one to two generations, keeping two broad 
objectives in mind.  

The first objective is to leverage the advantages of a youthful population to compete in the global 
economy. Later wave countries can develop their relatively young populations into the highly skilled 
workforces the world will need. Investment in developing human capital should start with today’s 
children. For example, improving nutrition to prevent stunting and wasting will deliver returns many 
times over. Similarly, investing in high-quality and accessible education for children and young adults 
can help build the crucial job skills needed for workers to be highly productive. Developing robust 
public infrastructure, including on the digital front, is crucial for later wave countries. 

As the center of gravity of global consumers and talent tilts toward later wave regions, policy makers 
and businesses can also support the development of the next generation of global superstar 

68

Dependency and depopulation?companies. Previous MGI research has found that developing economies that outperform their 
peers are propelled by large, competitive companies.72 Nurturing such businesses requires creating 
an environment conducive to their growth and innovation, including robust institutions, necessary 
physical infrastructure, intellectual property protections, and the ability of companies to leverage 
outside investment and partnerships.

The second objective is to design and implement effective and sustainable support systems for the 
elderly and for society at large. Learning from the successes and failures of first wave countries will 
be crucial here. Old-age support systems in later wave countries are often informal and family based, 
but as countries develop, they should anticipate pressure for stronger and better-integrated social 
support systems for seniors.73 At the same time, the looming burden of a senior gap that needs to 
be increasingly funded through public debt in first wave countries (as we described in chapter 2.3) 
should make later wave governments cautious about what they promise. It will be vital to create 
retirement systems that emphasize fiscal sustainability and acknowledge the realities of declining 
fertility and increasing longevity as well as their implications for supporting aging populations. 
Financial inclusion and incentives for private savings and wealth accumulation today can be bedrocks 
for economic resilience in the future.

Another foreseeable problem that later wave countries could sidestep with early action is that of 
burgeoning healthcare costs. Younger countries can invest in the health and well-being of their 
young to middle-aged populations to keep them thriving well into older age. This includes investing 
in access to preventive healthcare and public education to increase “healthspans.” Research from 
the McKinsey Health Institute has identified specific actions that governments and businesses can 
take to promote healthy longevity, ranging from accelerating innovation and health measurement to 
scaling specific interventions proven to promote healthy aging.74

To get rich before getting old, later wave regions will need to pull on all growth levers. Companies 
aiming to capitalize on the opportunities that will arise in later wave countries will play an important 
role, alongside infrastructure and public services that policy makers can provide. By compensating 
for a dwindling demographic dividend with more productive jobs, populations of later wave countries 
can ensure a better chance of navigating demographic change successfully.

4. Responding to a new 
demographic reality

Over the next quarter century—and perhaps beyond—demographics is destiny. Changing population 
structures have already begun forcing changes in business operations and production and altering 
long-standing social norms and practices. As demographic shifts pick up steam, however, we can 
no longer simply react in isolation to each of the tectonic changes they will compel. Workforces, 
productivity, global trade, family structures, and the social contract all will change as a result of the 
impact—and we haven’t even begun to grasp the feedback loops these changes may kick off.  

The long-term effects of falling fertility rates will reach far
The economic calculus that has improved living standards for so many people around the globe for 
so long will need to change—and profoundly. In previous chapters, we’ve examined individually the 
effects of aging on economic growth, labor markets, consumption, and the gap that nations will face 
in sustaining senior consumption. Yet these factors are not independent. The world is powered by an 
interconnected economic system with feedback loops that reinforce one another. As demographic 
drags intensify and low fertility rates compound and snowball into population decline, there could be 
potential knock-on effects for aggregate demand, investment, the generation of innovative ideas, 
and, ultimately, productivity that go beyond the economic consequences we have outlined. 

In particular, depopulation could affect many sectors of the economy in unanticipated ways. Just 
imagine schools needing to adjust to a precipitous drop in the number of students or even closing 
altogether, as they already have in some places. Many home buyers today look for houses with “in-law 
rooms” to accommodate aging parents, yet the value of those homes could plateau or decline if the 
number of households shrinks. For decades, rural communities have faced plateauing home prices 
as they lost people to fast-growing urban centers, but whole nations depopulating would have 
significantly more severe consequences. Declining asset prices and shrinking pools of workers to 
generate income could challenge debt sustainability and the social contract, sparking struggles that 
reverberate throughout society. 

The challenges go beyond the economic hurdles that we have examined—they could have big 
implications for human development and the geopolitical balance. On the human development side, 
shifts in the weights of global population could amplify the importance of issues such as gender 
parity and child nutrition, as more population growth occurs in regions that lag behind on these 
dimensions. Shifting global demographics will also influence the reconfiguration of global trade flows.  
The view of future global interconnections will require a new lens that incorporates demographic 
changes in the aperture as the world’s center of gravity tilts toward later wave regions in the coming 
half century. Businesses can consider talent supply as an additional factor to shape their global 
footprint, along with the shifting global map of consumers. Meanwhile, policy makers can weigh 
options to secure longer-term access to human capital by investing in infrastructure and education  
in less developed later wave regions. 

71

Dependency and depopulation?Societies are entering uncharted waters as they address changing  
population trajectories
Looking to the longer term, forecasts of the balance of population are not necessarily fixed. As the 
reality of the demographic shift sets in, social discourse about fertility rates and aging is escalating, 
and issues to do with population size, growth, and composition are increasingly becoming the 
flashpoint of many local and national debates. Society at large will increasingly engage in questions 
and choices about fertility and migration, particularly in first wave countries but increasingly in later 
wave ones as well. 

Relatedly, fundamental questions about families, their structures, and where they live will arise. How 
many children to have and who should take care of them—alongside parents who are living longer and 
longer—will raise difficult questions about cultural norms, social standards, and traditional, gender-
based expectations of caregiver roles and whether and how they could change. So far, countries have 
struggled to have these difficult conversations, but the dialogue will continue.

Policy makers have attempted to turn back the clock on societal aging by implementing family-
friendly policies and economic incentives to remove barriers to raising the fertility rate, among 
other objectives. These have met with limited success; no country where the fertility rate has ever 
fallen below 1.9 has a rate above replacement today. At the same time, we have limited experience 
of concerted efforts to cause fertility to rebound across a range of countries or subnational regions, 
and so we can’t clearly foresee what the future might look like. Scientific discovery may kick in, 
for example, mitigating contributors to low and falling fertility rates or resulting in innovation in 
reproduction that shifts people’s willingness to have more children. Cultural shifts may be triggered 
by changing societal attitudes and human behavior in a myriad of ways that are more conducive to 
rising fertility rates.   

Even as societies grapple with grave long-term implications of changing demographics, businesses 
and policy makers have many options in the shorter term. Improved child- and eldercare programs 
can help increase labor force participation and encourage workers to plan for families alongside 
work. Tailored migration programs can attract workers who have in-demand skills, provided migrants 
are well integrated into both labor markets and society more broadly. 

72

Dependency and depopulation?Economic responses to societal aging are already visible and will intensify
Businesses and policy makers are changing their strategies and processes to reflect the emerging 
reality of an older population with a shifting global footprint, and we will both need and see more 
innovation on the following fronts in the coming decade. 

 — Doubling down on productivity growth through investment. Productivity has grown sluggishly in 
much of the world over the past two decades, and the need for it is strongest in places, sectors, 
and skill categories where labor supply is tightening the most. Recent MGI research suggests that 
occupations with historically low productivity and low productivity growth, such as healthcare, 
construction, leisure and hospitality, and professional services, will be most affected by the 
demographic shift.75 Automation and AI technologies hold great potential to augment dwindling 
workforces, and companies can develop more strategic reskilling practices for humans to work 
alongside machines, which can increase productivity. Policy makers can find opportunities to 
increase public investment in infrastructure and R&D, creating conditions that generate adequate 
returns on investment for productive enterprises that are the biggest force creating jobs and 
raising living standards. 

 — Creatively managing an older workforce to sustain productivity. The concept of retirement has 
blurred and may become an outdated construct altogether with societal participation later in life. 
More flexible work hours could encourage retirees to pick up part-time work, even as companies 
build their capacity to hire from these nontraditional labor pools and onboard older workers 
with the coaching and mentorship they need to succeed. Creating opportunities specifically 
for seniors is important: 19 to 25 percent of respondents aged 65 and older surveyed by the 
McKinsey Health Institute say they want to work but are not currently doing so for a variety of 
reasons, including a lack of attractive opportunities and societal barriers.76 In first wave regions 
already experiencing youth scarcity, companies have begun focusing more on opportunities to 
hire senior workers. For example, CVS, the drugstore chain, is tapping some of its older customers 
to be employees through a program called Talent Is Ageless.77 CVS supports mature workers 
with working arrangements like telecommuting, flexible time, job sharing, and compressed work 
weeks. It also offers continuing career education. ANZ, the Australia and New Zealand bank, 
launched an age diversity strategy to create a workplace culture where “age is no barrier.” It 
includes multiple career extension options, eliminating qualifications-based career advancement, 
and age-inclusive recruitment ads.78

 — Tapping the potential of senior consumers. Businesses will face shifts in the relative sizes of 

markets as the purchasing power of senior consumers grows while that of younger consumers 
plateaus or shrinks. Demand at the category level will change, with society needing more 
healthcare and less education. Within-category shifts, for instance more dog strollers and fewer 
baby strollers, are changes that have implications for product portfolios. Companies will need to 
shed tired stereotypes and generalizations about older consumers and gain granular consumer 
insights to reach varied segments of seniors effectively. Some companies are already making 
significant bets on older consumers. For instance, Nestlé Health Science, a division of Nestlé 
devoted to nutrition, health, and wellness, shuttered a baby food manufacturing facility in Ireland 
due to declining birth rates in China. Now it plans to offer more supplements and nutritional 
products aimed at the needs of seniors to, say, manage their weight or blood sugar levels.79 
Vayyar in Israel has developed sensor technology to help detect falls and reduced mobility among 
older adults; the technology doesn’t require cameras and wearables but instead uses radar 
systems to maintain privacy.80 In Canada, Silverts offers innovative, fashionable, adaptive clothing 
and shoes for older adults, with fewer small buttons and hooks, to allow older adults to remain 
independent longer.81 Not all needs of senior customers are obvious. In the Netherlands, for 
example, Jumbo Supermarket created “chat checkout” lanes in its grocery stores.82 These allow 
for a slower checkout process aimed at providing an opportunity for older adults to converse with 
the cashier to combat an increasing problem of loneliness among seniors.

73

Dependency and depopulation? — Managing dependency through increased workforce participation. Policy makers in many 

advanced economies have taken steps to reform pension systems to encourage older people to 
work longer. For example, Italy’s reform of early retirement in 2011 raised labor force participation 
among 55- to 64-year-olds from roughly 40 percent to 60 percent in 2023 (for more on pensions, 
see sidebar “Pension tensions: Sense on the dollar?”). Policy makers also can promote age-
friendly workplaces, for example, by promoting flexible work arrangements in the public and 
private sectors and addressing barriers that prevent older adults from working. Additionally, 
policy makers can take steps to expand workforce participation, particularly among women. In 
Japan, for instance, “Womenomics” policies provide daycare support and tax incentives to boost 
female labor force participation, which increased 12 percentage points from 2010 to 2023, double 
the initial goal.83 Policy makers can also invest in lifelong learning opportunities and retraining 
initiatives to enable adaptation to changing job market demands. Examples include Singapore’s 
SkillsFuture program, which retrains workers 65 years and older, and voluntary welfare 
organizations that help seniors make career transitions and financial plans for retirement.84

 — Evolving fiscally sustainable systems for an aging world. Policy action coupled with corporate 
talent for innovation will be essential to develop substantially new approaches to pensions and 
retirement savings. First wave economies might consider ways to help citizens save for retirement 
from a younger age, for example via tax-advantaged retirement investment accounts. Steps 
to boost affordable healthcare services, including long-term care, could reduce the costs of 
longevity to individuals and society. Policy makers can avoid expensive rewiring by designing 
public services to address the demographic profile of the future. For instance, urban design and 
zoning can be optimized to account for future needs, such as zoning for smaller housing units 
to better suit a future with fewer children. Investing in public amenities that support aging in 
place would allow seniors to maintain independence and mobility, reducing the need for public 
resources. Policy makers can also encourage healthy living through public health campaigns that 
promote access to nutritious foods and provide opportunities for physical activity to facilitate 
healthy longevity. 

§ § §

The uncertainties of demographic change will persist for decades, and societies will need to wrestle 
with them. Meanwhile, the world will need to learn to live with the change, at least in the short term, 
and policy makers and civil society will need to inform and guide choices that society at large must 
make over the coming half century.

Dependency and depopulation?Glossary

Age mix: The age composition of a population, 
representing the proportion of people in 
different age groups at a specific time. This 
composition changes over time as a result of 
populations aging and changes in fertility rates, 
longevity, and migration.85

Age-related public expenditures: Spending 
composed of public expenditures, which 
vary according to the age of constituents; for 
example, pensions, healthcare, and education.

Demographic dividend: The benefit a country 
accrues when the growth rate of its working 
population outstrips that of minors and seniors, 
setting the stage for population-driven 
economic growth and prosperity.86 

Demographic drag: The opposite of 
demographic dividend. If fertility rates remain 
low over the long run, population dynamics 
negatively affect economic growth, as older 
cohorts that are not in the labor force grow 
faster than cohorts of working individuals.87

Depopulation: The sustained net decrease in 
population size in a defined territory over time.

Labor intensity: The amount of work done 
per person at each age, measured as weekly 
hours worked per person in an age group 
(increments of five years) across both workers 
and nonworkers in the population.

Net migration: The net total of migrants during 
a period; that is, the number of people who 

enter a region (immigrants) minus the number of 
people who leave a region (emigrants), including 
citizens and noncitizens.88

Population pyramid: A graphic illustration of 
a population’s age structure, with the x-axis 
representing the number of men (on the left) 
and women (on the right) across different age 
groups, which are plotted on the y-axis. In 
economies with high birth rates, this graph 
takes the form of a pyramid, with a wide base 
representing a high share of young people 
and the number of individuals decreasing 
progressively in older age groups.89

Productivity: A measure of output relative to 
input. We focus on labor productivity, which 
is defined as GDP per hour worked. This is a 
commonly used productivity measure and the 
most consequential determinant of long-run 
economic and real wage growth.90

Replacement rate: The level of fertility, or live 
births per woman, at which each generation 
exactly replaces itself without migration but 
including mortality up to reproductive ages. 
This is typically about 2.1 births per woman 
when mortality is very low.91

Senior gap: The gap between the total 
consumption and the labor income earned 
within a given year by seniors aged 65 and over. 
For a senior to maintain consumption, this gap 
needs to be “filled” via personal savings, returns 

to assets, public transfers such as pensions, 
and private transfers such as family care.

Support ratio: A ratio that compares the 
number of individuals aged 15 to 64 years, or 
working age, to the population aged 65 and 
over. It provides a rough indicator of the number 
of working-age people who could support 
seniors economically and socially.92

Total fertility rate: The average number of 
live births that a hypothetical cohort of women 
would have at the end of their reproductive 
period, assuming that during their whole lives, 
they had the single-year fertility rates of a 
given period. It is expressed as live births  
per woman.93

Weekly hours per capita: The total annual 
working hours per person for an entire 
population divided by 52 weeks (regardless 
of holidays). This is distinct from the number 
of hours worked per worker, which measures 
the average (or, in some cases, modal) number 
of hours worked by those in the labor force in 
a week.

Working-age population: The share of 15- to 
64-year-olds in the total population. A basic 
indicator of potential employment, it includes 
the economically active population and the 
economically inactive population.94

The word “fertility” has a different meaning in 
the vernacular compared with its use among 
demographers. In demographic terms, the total 
fertility rate is the total number of children each 
woman in a population would be expected to have 
over her lifetime if the fertility rates at each age 
remained constant over time. The United Nations 
defines replacement-level fertility as 2.1 children per 
woman over her lifetime, which represents the rate 
needed to keep population flat over time.

Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, a researcher in 
economics and demographics, argues that the 
world is already below the replacement rate. Some 
UN fertility rates are slightly higher than reported 
by some countries, and the world’s replacement 
rate is slightly higher than 2.1, given gender bias in 
some countries and higher infant mortality rates.

fertility affect economic growth, worldwide? Jesús

In fact, all else being equal, higher fertility rates 
may reduce GDP per capita growth in the short to 
medium term, because the denominator (number of 
people) increases without necessarily increasing the 
numerator (GDP). Dynamically, other forces, such as 
additional births increasing demand, may also raise 
GDP, but these are unlikely to be enough.

how much an individual wants to consume before

absolute level of the senior gap is less informative 
than the change in the gap over time. This analysis is 
inspired by the “old-age gap,” a concept conceived 
by Andrew Mason and Ronald Lee. See Andrew

33  Economists have long held that consumption, like 
labor, follows an inverted U-shape indicating that 
those 65 years and older consume less than those in 
middle age. This shape is a result of consumption as 
typically measured at the household level. Middle-
aged households generally include children and 
thus have more people, making their expenditure 
as a unit larger than that of smaller households like 
those of elderly couples. However, adjusted for 
household size, consumption grows with age. Data 
from Eurostat shows that household consumption 
peaks when the head of the household is aged 45 
to 59 years, but average individual consumption 
peaks past age 65 when household size is taken into 
account. This produces a flattened, slightly upward 
sloping consumption curve rather than the traditional 
inverted U.

48  Two factors explain this. First, older individuals 
have higher homeownership rates than younger 
cohorts, at 82 percent compared with 64 percent for 
average adults. Second, most seniors have owned 
their homes for longer, enabling them to pay off 
bigger portions of their mortgages and benefit from 
increasing real estate prices for longer.

58  Assuming current age-specific employment, labor 
force participation rate, and hours worked per  
week persist through 2050. This forecast is likely 
to be conservative. Some evidence suggests that 
the labor force participation rate among the elderly 
increases as a country ages, as has been seen in 
Japan, for example.

59  The share of workers over 50 is approximated by 
those in 50- to 79-year-old age group, because 
ILOSTAT does not publish hours estimates for 
individuals aged 80 and older.

60  Over the past 25 years, increasing incomes have 

spurred the largest increases in consumption, while 
growing populations and demographic shifts have 
played a secondary role. Between 1997 and 2023, 
increasing incomes explained almost 80 percent of 
aggregate consumption growth, and as population 
growth stagnates over the next quarter century, 
higher incomes are likely to explain almost all of 
consumption growth.
