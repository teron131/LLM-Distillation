Executive summary

Welcome to the 2024 edition of McKinsey’s annual 
review of private markets investing. Our ongoing 
research on the industry’s dynamics and performance 
has revealed several insights, including the 
following trends:

in line with global totals, while in Europe, fundraising 
proved most resilient, falling just 3 percent. In  
Asia, fundraising fell precipitously and now sits  
72 percent below the region’s 2018 peak. 

Macroeconomic challenges continued. If 2022 
was a tale of two halves, with robust fundraising and 
deal activity in the first six months followed by a 
slowdown in the second half, then 2023 might be 
considered a tale of one whole. Macroeconomic 
headwinds persisted throughout the year, with rising 
financing costs and an uncertain growth outlook 
taking a toll on private markets. Full-year fundraising 
continued to decline from 2021’s lofty peak, weighed 
down by the “denominator effect” that persisted  
in part due to a less active deal market. Managers 
largely held onto assets to avoid selling in a lower-
multiple environment, fueling an activity-dampening 
cycle in which distribution-starved limited partners 
(LPs) reined in new commitments. 

Performance in most private asset classes remained 
below historical averages for a second consecutive 
year. Decade-long tailwinds from low and falling 
interest rates and consistently expanding multiples 
seem to be things of the past. As private market 
managers look to boost performance in this new era 
of investing, a deeper focus on revenue growth and 
margin expansion will be needed now more than ever.

Despite difficult fundraising conditions, headwinds 
did not affect all strategies or managers equally. 
Private equity (PE) buyout strategies posted their best 
fundraising year ever, and larger managers and 
vehicles also fared well, continuing the prior year’s 
trend toward greater fundraising concentration.

The numerator effect persisted. Despite a marked 
recovery in the denominator—the 1,000 largest  
US retirement funds grew 7 percent in the year ending 
September 2023 after falling 14 percent the prior 
year,1 for example—many LPs remain overexposed 
to private markets relative to their target allocations. 
LPs started 2023 overweight: according to analysis 
from CEM Benchmarking, average allocations 
across PE, infrastructure, and real estate were at or 
above target allocations as of the beginning of  
the year. And the numerator grew throughout the 
year, as a lack of exits and rebounding valuations 
drove net asset values (NAVs) higher. While not all 
LPs strictly follow asset allocation targets, our 
analysis in partnership with global private markets 
firm StepStone Group suggests that an overallocation 
of just one percentage point can reduce planned 
commitments by as much as 10 to 12 percent per 
year for five years or more. 

Global fundraising contracted. Fundraising fell  
22 percent across private market asset classes 
globally to just over $1 trillion, as of year-end reported 
data—the lowest total since 2017. Fundraising in 
North America, a rare bright spot in 2022, declined 

Despite these headwinds, recent surveys indicate 
that LPs remain broadly committed to private markets. 
In fact, the majority plan to maintain or increase 
allocations over the medium to long term.

Private markets: A slower eraInvestors fled to known names and larger funds. 
Fundraising concentration reached its highest level 
in over a decade, as investors continued to shift new 
commitments in favor of the largest fund managers. 
The 25 most successful fundraisers collected 41 
percent of aggregate commitments to closed-end 
funds (with the top five managers accounting for 
nearly half that total). Closed-end fundraising totals 
may understate the extent of concentration in  
the industry overall, as the largest managers also 
tend to be more successful in raising non-
institutional capital.

While the largest funds grew even larger—the 
largest vehicles on record were raised in buyout, real 
estate, infrastructure, and private debt in 2023—
smaller and newer funds struggled. Fewer than 
1,700 funds of less than $1 billion were closed during 
the year, half as many as closed in 2022 and the 
fewest in any year since 2012. New manager 
formation also fell to the lowest level since 2012, 
with just 651 new firms launched in 2023. 

Whether recent fundraising concentration and  
a spate of M&A activity signals the beginning of oft-
rumored consolidation in the private markets 
remains uncertain, as a similar pattern developed  

in each of the last two fundraising downturns  
before giving way to renewed entrepreneurialism 
among general partners (GPs) and commitment 
diversification among LPs. Compared with how things 
played out in the last two downturns, perhaps this 
movie really is different, or perhaps we’re watching  
a trilogy reusing a familiar plotline.

Dry powder inventory spiked (again). Private 
markets assets under management totaled  
$13.1 trillion as of June 30, 2023, and have grown 
nearly 20 percent per annum since 2018. Dry 
powder reserves—the amount of capital committed 
but not yet deployed—increased to $3.7 trillion, 
marking the ninth consecutive year  
of growth. Dry powder inventory—the amount of 
capital available to GPs expressed as a multiple  
of annual deployment—increased for the second 
consecutive year in PE, as new commitments 
continued to outpace deal activity. Inventory sat  
at 1.6 years in 2023, up markedly from the  
0.9 years recorded at the end of 2021 but still  
within the historical range. NAV grew as well, 
largely driven by the reluctance of managers to exit 
positions and crystallize returns in a depressed 
multiple environment. 

Decade-long tailwinds from low  
and falling interest rates and 
consistently expanding multiples  
seem to be things of the past.

Private markets: A slower eraPrivate equity strategies diverged. Buyout and 
venture capital, the two largest PE sub-asset 
classes, charted wildly different courses over the 
past 18 months. Buyout notched its highest fund-
raising year ever in 2023, and its performance 
improved, with funds posting a (still paltry) 5 percent 
net internal rate of return through September 30. 
And although buyout deal volumes declined by  
19 percent, 2023 was still the third-most-active year 
on record. In contrast, venture capital (VC) fundraising 
declined by nearly 60 percent, equaling its lowest 
total since 2015, and deal volume fell by 36 percent 
to the lowest level since 2019. VC funds returned  
–3 percent through September, posting negative 
returns for seven consecutive quarters. VC was  
the fastest-growing—as well as the highest-

About this report

McKinsey is the leading adviser to private markets firms, including 
private equity, real estate, private debt, and infrastructure firms,  
with a global practice substantially larger than any other firm. We are 
also the leading consultant partner to the institutional investors  
that allocate capital to private markets, such as pensions, insurance 
companies, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations,  
and family offices. 

This is the 2024 edition of our annual review of private markets.1 To 
produce it, we have developed new analyses drawn from our 
long-running research on private markets, based on the industry’s 
leading sources of data and in conjunction with StepStone Group  
and CEM Benchmarking.2 We have also gathered insights from our 
colleagues around the world who work closely with the world’s  
leading GPs and LPs. 

We welcome your questions and suggestions at

1   We define private markets as closed-end funds investing in private equity, real estate, 
private debt, infrastructure, or natural resources, as well as related secondaries and 
funds of funds. We exclude hedge funds and, except where otherwise noted, publicly 
traded or open-end funds.

2  All data for 2023 figures is based on reported numbers and will likely adjust as more 

figures continue to be reported. Performance data is as of September 30 for vintages  
2000–2020, unless otherwise noted; AUM data is as of June 30; and fundraising data 
cover the full year 2023. All data for Asia excludes Australia and New Zealand unless

performing—PE strategy by a significant margin 
from 2010 to 2022, but investors appear  
to be reevaluating their approach in the  
current environment. 

Private equity entry multiples contracted. PE 
buyout entry multiples declined by roughly one turn 
from 11.9 to 11.0 times EBITDA, slightly outpacing  
the decline in public market multiples (down from 
12.1 to 11.3 times EBITDA), through the first nine 
months of 2023. For nearly a decade leading up to 
2022, managers consistently sold assets into a 
higher-multiple environment than that in which they 
had bought those assets, providing a substantial 
performance tailwind for the industry. Nowhere has 
this been truer than in technology. After experiencing 
more than eight turns of multiple expansion from 
2009 to 2021 (the most of any sector), technology 
multiples have declined by nearly three turns in the 
past two years, 50 percent more than in any other 
sector. Overall, roughly two-thirds of the total return 
for buyout deals that were entered in 2010 or later 
and exited in 2021 or before can be attributed to 
market multiple expansion and leverage. Now, with 
falling multiples and higher financing costs,  
revenue growth and margin expansion are taking 
center stage for GPs.

Real estate receded. Demand uncertainty, slowing 
rent growth, and elevated financing costs drove cap 
rates higher and made price discovery challenging, 
all of which weighed on deal volume, fundraising, and 
investment performance. Global closed-end 
fundraising declined 34 percent year over year, and 
funds returned −4 percent in the first nine months  
of the year, losing money for the first time since the 
2007–08 global financial crisis. Capital shifted 
away from core and core-plus strategies as investors 
sought liquidity via redemptions in open-end 
vehicles, from which net outflows reached their 
highest level in at least two decades. Opportunistic 
strategies benefited from this shift, with investors 
focusing on capital appreciation over income gener-
a tion in a market where alternative sources of yield 
have grown more attractive. Rising interest rates 
widened bid–ask spreads and impaired deal volume 
across food groups, including in what were formerly 
hot sectors: multifamily and industrial. 

Private markets: A slower eraPrivate markets still have work to do on diversity. 
Private markets firms are slowly improving their 
representation of females (up two percentage points 
over the prior year) and ethnic and racial minorities 
(up one percentage point). On some diversity metrics, 
including entry-level represen tation of women, 
private markets now compare favorably with corpo-
rate America. Yet broad-based parity remains 
elusive and too slow in the making. Ethnic, racial, and 
gender imbalances are particularly stark across 
more influential investing roles and senior positions. 
In fact, McKinsey’s research reveals that, at the 
current pace, it would take several decades for private 
markets firms to reach gender parity at senior levels. 
Increasing representation across all levels will require 
managers to take fresh approaches to hiring, 
retention, and promotion.

Artificial intelligence generating excitement. The 
transformative potential of generative AI was 
perhaps 2023’s hottest topic (beyond Taylor Swift). 
Private markets players are excited about the 
potential for the technology to optimize their approach 
to thesis generation, deal sourcing, investment  
due diligence, and portfolio performance, among 
other areas. While the technology is still nascent  
and few GPs can boast scaled implementations, 
pilot programs are already in flight across the 
industry, particularly within portfolio companies. 
Adoption seems nearly certain to accelerate 
throughout 2024.

Private debt pays dividends. Debt again proved  
to be the most resilient private asset class against a 
turbulent market backdrop. Fundraising declined 
just 13 percent, largely driven by lower commitments 
to direct lending strategies, for which a slower PE 
deal environment has made capital deployment 
challenging. The asset class also posted the highest 
returns among all private asset classes through 
September 30. Many private debt securities are tied 
to floating rates, which enhance returns in a rising-
rate environment. Thus far, managers appear to 
have successfully navigated the rising incidence of 
default and distress exhibited across the broader 
leveraged lending market. Although direct lending 
deal volume declined from 2022, private lenders 
financed an all-time high 59 percent of leveraged 
buyout transactions last year and are now expanding 
into additional strategies to drive the next era  
of growth.

Infrastructure took a detour. After several years  
of robust growth and strong performance, infra-
structure and natural resources fundraising declined 
by 53 percent to the lowest total since 2013. Supply-
side timing is partially to blame: five of the seven 
largest infrastructure managers closed a flagship 
vehicle in 2021 or 2022, and none of those five held 
a final close last year. As in real estate, investors 
shied away from core and core-plus investments in  
a higher-yield environment. Yet there are reasons  
to believe infrastructure’s growth will bounce back. 
Limited partners (LPs) surveyed by McKinsey  
remain bullish on their deployment to the asset 
class, and at least a dozen vehicles targeting  
more than $10 billion were actively fundraising as  
of the end of 2023. Multiple recent acquisitions of 
large infrastructure GPs by global multi-asset-class 
managers also indicate market wide conviction in  
the asset class’s potential.

Private markets: A slower era1 Private markets in  

a slower era

If private markets investors entered 2023 hoping for a return to the heady days of 2021, they 
likely left the year disappointed. Many of the headwinds that emerged in the latter half of 2022 
persisted throughout the year, pressuring fundraising, dealmaking, and performance. Inflation 
moderated somewhat over the course of the year but remained stubbornly elevated by recent 
historical standards. Interest rates started high and rose higher, increasing the cost of financing. 
A reinvigorated public equity market recovered most of 2022’s losses but did little to resolve  
the valuation uncertainty private market investors have faced for the past 18 months. 

Within private markets, the denominator effect remained in play, despite the public market 
recovery, as the numerator continued to expand. An activity-dampening cycle emerged: higher 
cost of capital and lower multiples limited the ability or willingness of general partners (GPs)  
to exit positions; fewer exits, coupled with continuing capital calls, pushed limited partner 
allocations higher, thereby limiting their ability or willingness to make new commitments. These 
conditions weighed on managers’ ability to fundraise. Based on data reported as of year-end 
2023, private markets fundraising fell 22 percent from the prior year to just over $1 trillion, the 
largest such drop since 2009. 

The impact of the fundraising environment was not felt equally among GPs. Continuing a trend 
that emerged in 2022, and consistent with prior downturns in fundraising, LPs favored larger 
vehicles and the scaled GPs that typically manage them. Smaller and newer managers struggled, 
and the number of sub–$1 billion vehicles and new firm launches each declined to its lowest level 
in more than a decade.

Despite the decline in fundraising, private markets assets under management (AUM) continued 
to grow, increasing 12 percent to $13.1 trillion as of June 30, 2023. 2023 fundraising was still  
the sixth-highest annual haul on record, pushing dry powder higher, while the slowdown in deal 
making limited distributions.

Private markets: A slower eraInvestment performance across private market 
asset classes fell short of historical averages. Private 
equity (PE) got back in the black but generated the 
lowest annual performance in the past 15 years, 
excluding 2022. Closed-end real estate produced 
negative returns for the first time since 2009, as 
capitalization (cap) rates expanded across sectors 
and rent growth dissipated in formerly hot sectors, 
including multifamily and industrial. The performance 
of infrastructure funds was less than half of its  
long-term average and even further below the 
double-digit returns generated in 2021 and 2022. 

Private debt was the standout performer (if there 
was one), outperforming all other private asset 
classes and illustrating the asset class’s counter-
cyclical appeal.

Fundraising
Global private markets fundraising fell 22 percent 
year over year to $1.0 trillion, the lowest total  
since 2017 (Exhibit 1). Fundraising in every asset 
class and region declined from the prior year.

Private markets: A slower eraOn the heels of a record-setting 2022, fundraising  
in North America declined 22 percent in 2023 
(Exhibit 2). North America–focused infrastructure 
and natural resources led the decline, falling  
41 percent, followed by closed-end real estate, down 
37 percent. PE and private debt fundraising in the 
region proved slightly more resilient in comparison, 
decreasing 16 percent and 15 percent, respectively. 

In Europe, fundraising declined 3 percent to  
$243 billion. The region’s apparent resilience last 
year is somewhat illusory, as fundraising in the 
region fell by 24 percent the prior year and has now 
declined 27 percent from the record high achieved 
in 2021. Fundraising in North America, in comparison, 
fell 20 percent over the two-year period. That said, 
fundraising for Europe-focused PE strategies was a 
bright spot in 2023, increasing 57 percent year  
over year to set a new record high for the region. 
Fundraising declined in all other asset classes.

Fundraising in Asia declined 48 percent to $79 billion, 
marking a 13-year low. The paltry haul in 2023  
was 72 percent below 2018’s $285 billion peak. A 
confluence of factors—including the ongoing 
influence of government regulations (such as asset 
management product regulations in 2018 and 
private fund regulations in 2023) that make it more 
difficult to raise capital—has contributed to the 
multiyear fundraising decline for Asia-focused funds 
broadly and particularly for China-focused funds. 
The fundraising decline was widespread across all 
asset classes, and fundraising in infrastructure  
and natural resources and PE each declined by 
more than 50 percent.

The numerator effect
Many institutional investors entered 2023 with 
current private markets allocations that exceeded 
target allocations. This phenomenon resulted, in 
part, from a sharp decline in the value of investors’

Private markets: A slower erapublic market holdings in 2022, reducing the value 
of overall portfolios (the denominator) without a 
corresponding decline in private markets holdings 
(the numerator). This so-called denominator effect 
could be observed across asset classes: average 
allocations to PE, real estate, and infrastructure as 
of the beginning of 2023 matched or exceeded 
average target allocations (Exhibit 3). Only allocations 
to private debt—perhaps not coincidentally, the 
most resilient asset class in terms of 2023 
fundraising—were below targets at the beginning  
of the year.

In 2023, the denominator recovered: the 1,000 largest 
US retirement funds grew 7 percent in the year 
ending September 2023 after falling 14 percent the 
prior year.2 But many LPs remained overallocated  
to private markets due to growth in the numerator, 
that is, the net asset value in private markets.  
The net asset value of global private markets 
increased 10 percent year over year as of June 2023. 
NAV growth was exacerbated by continuing capital 
calls and fewer exits. In 2023, capital calls exceeded 
distributions by 80 percent—the largest relative 
difference since 2009.

Private markets: A slower eraEven seemingly small degrees of overallocation can 
have a substantial impact on future commitments for 
investors seeking to adhere to their asset allocation 
targets. For example, global private markets firm 
StepStone Group has determined that a 1 percent 
overweight position in PE today could reduce 
investors’ planned commitments by as much as  
12 percent annually over the next five years.  
This magnitude likely understates the true impact  
in today’s market, as investors were largely 
underallocated before becoming overallocated in 
2022. The analysis studied the difference in planned 
commitments that StepStone’s proprietary pacing 
model would suggest for a hypothetical $100 billion 
institutional investor with a mature PE portfolio and 
a 10 percent target allocation (that is, $10 billion) 
between three different starting points in 2024: 

1.  At weight (10 percent current allocation, equal 
to the target allocation). The pacing model calls 
for nearly $2.7 billion in annual commitments  
on average over the next five years to maintain 
the 10 percent target.

2.  Overweight by one percentage point (11 percent 
current allocation). The pacing model calls  
for approximately $2.4 billion on average, or 
$270 million (10 percent) less per year, to  
return to the 10 percent target.

3.  Underweight by one percentage point (9 percent 

actual allocation). The pacing model calls  
for $3.1 billion on average, or $380 million  
(14 percent) more per year, to return to  
the 10 percent target.

The analysis suggests that fundraising headwinds 
may persist for several years, in the absence of 
meaningful deviations from the current trajectory, and 
relies on two key assumptions. The first is total 
portfolio (denominator) growth of 5.5 percent per 
year, which is in line with typical assumptions used  
for such modeling. The second is exit/distribution 
rates (which affect the size of the numerator) 
consistent with long-term market norms. If either 

assumption is proven to be materially incorrect—
that is, if the denominator grows more quickly  
or the exit velocity exceeds historical averages—
overallocation pressures may subside. 

Though the denominator effect may weigh on short- 
and mid-term fundraising, the long-term outlook for 
capital formation remains intact as long as LPs’ 
behavior matches their stated intent. For example, in 
a recent McKinsey survey of over 300 LPs globally,3 
43 percent of respondents said they anticipate 
increasing their allocations to private markets over 
the next three years; only 22 percent said they 
expect to decrease allocations.

Concentration among large managers
Fundraising headwinds that persisted in 2023 
affected managers unequally. Fundraising grew more 
concentrated among large managers in 2023, 
continuing a trend from the prior year and consistent 
with the capital rotation that also emerged in prior 
fundraising downturns. In 2023, the top 25 fund 
managers amassed 41 percent of all funds raised, 
the most since 2008 (Exhibit 4). The top ten 
managers alone captured 26 percent of fundraising. 
Not coincidentally, an outsized share of fundraising 
went to larger individual funds. GPs raised 36 funds 
larger than $5 billion in 2023, the second most  
on record, including the largest fund ever in each  
of private debt, real estate, infrastructure, and 
buyouts (Exhibit 5). 

Smaller and newer managers struggled in this 
environment. Only 1,650 funds of less than $1 billion 
closed during the year, the fewest since 2012 and 
about half the number formed in 2022. Just 651 new 
firms launched last year, also the lowest such  
total since 2012. In what is typically an enormously 
entrepreneurial industry, venturing out on one’s  
own was exceedingly difficult in 2023.

After a decade of relative consistency in private 
markets’ industry structure, fundraising in the last 
two years has become more concentrated. However, 
concentration among larger managers has

powder grew to a new high of $3.7 trillion, 19 percent 
above the prior year. 

Private markets AUM has grown nearly 14 percent 
per year since 2013 as institutional investors steadily 
increase allocations to private asset classes. 
Institutional investors typically allocate to private 

markets in search of higher absolute returns, which 
are required for some to meet their mid- and long-
term funding obligations, and to diversify their 
portfolios. According to CEM Benchmarking, private 
markets represented 27 percent of institutional 
portfolios at the beginning of 2023, ten percentage 
points above their level ten years prior (Exhibit 7).

Private markets: A slower eraPerformance
Performance was subdued across private markets 
asset classes. After losing money in 2022 for the 
first time since the global financial crisis, PE produced 
a net IRR of 2.5 percent through September 30, 2023. 
Despite a marked uptick in performance over the 
prior year, cumulative returns over the last seven 
quarters remain negative. Within PE, buyouts returned 
4.9 percent during the first nine months of the year, 
while venture capital (VC) returned −2.9 percent. As 
of September, buyouts had outperformed VC for 
seven consecutive quarters, a marked reversal from 
the recent past: VC had outperformed buyouts in 
seven of the ten years prior to 2022. 

Private debt produced a net IRR of 5.1 percent  
(6.9 percent annualized) through September 30, 
2023, the highest among private markets asset 
classes. Private debt benefited from higher interest 
rates and relative insulation from valuation volatility 
(due to its position in the capital structure), true to its 
reputation as a safe haven in uncertain times. 

Infrastructure and natural resources returned  
3.4 percent and 1.7 percent, well below historical 
median returns of 10.2 and 7.6 percent, respectively. 
Factors associated with the lower performance 
were increased interest rates, lower energy prices, 
and other macroeconomic headwinds. 

Closed-end real estate funds also lost money in 
2023, producing a net IRR of −3.5 percent amid 
slowing rent growth and cap rate expansion. The 
performance decline occurred across sectors, 
including in multifamily and industrial. These two 
sectors had outperformed in the prior year,  
which helped offset the broader decline resulting 
from poor performance of the office sector. 

PE remains the best-performing private markets 
asset class over the long run. The median net  
IRR for PE funds raised between 2011 and 2020 was  
16.4 percent as of September 30, 2023, which 
exceeds the top-quartile return of all other private 
asset classes. At the same time, the spread between 
top- and bottom-quartile PE funds of the above 
vintages was 15 percentage points, 300 basis points 
in spread more than any other asset class (Exhibit 8).

Private markets: A slower eraSuch dispersion of fund performance within PE 
implies that optimal strategy and fund selection 
matters greatly for returns that LPs achieve in 
allocating to the asset class. Indeed, performance 
relative to the median is often the key measuring 
stick for teams managing private asset portfolios.

Spotlight on secondaries 
Fundraising for secondaries strategies totaled  
$76 billion, up 92 percent year over year, making 
2023 the second-highest year on record (Exhibit 9). 
Though the secondaries market has deepened in 
recent years, relative concentration among a small 
number of scaled players often results in annual 
fundraising volatility. In 2023, for instance, just three 
funds accounted for $47 billion of funds raised, 
surpassing the entire strategy’s fundraising haul in 
each of 2021 and 2022. 

Secondaries funds have now raised more than  
$255 billion in aggregate over the last four years, 
nearly twice the total raised in the preceding  
four-year period. Backed by several years of robust 
fundraising, secondaries funds play an increasingly 
important role for LPs and GPs. Global secondaries 
deal volume grew 4 percent to $112 billion, making 
2023 the second most active year on record.5 And 
GP-led deals, including continuation vehicles, 
totaled $52 billion, the third year in a row where 
volume exceeded $50 billion. GPs now commonly 
employ continuation vehicles to provide exit 
opportunities for LPs while extending hold periods 
for higher-performing assets. 

LP-led deals totaled $60 billion, up 7 percent year 
over year. Given that PE allocations have exceeded 
targets for many LPs in today’s environment, 
secondary sales offer a mechanism to rebalance

Private markets: A slower eraa portfolio, enabling LPs to make fresh commitments 
into new fund vintages. Among LPs that sold 
positions in 2023, 36 percent did so principally to 
generate liquidity, versus just 14 percent a year  
ago. Still, LP-led deal volume was slightly lower last 
year than at its peak in 2021, suggesting that, 
despite the benefits of using secondaries as 
portfolio management tools, LPs have not moved en 
masse to exit positions, in part because of the 
discount required to do so.

Secondaries pricing stabilized in 2023 after  
a considerable drop in 2022. In buyouts, pricing 
improved from 87 percent of NAV to 91 percent, 
suggesting that the market is beginning to agree 
with asset marks, though the 2023 level remains 
below the seven-year average. VC and real estate 
pricing, conversely, remained steeply discounted, 
trading at 68 percent and 71 percent of NAV, 
respectively, signaling continued investor skepticism 
of current marks in these asset classes. 

Spotlight on non-institutional capital
The entrance of non-institutional capital, such as 
high net worth and retail, into the private markets 
landscape is one of the most significant structural 
shifts in recent years. While the majority of private 
markets AUM continues to be sourced from 
institutional investors, non-institutional channels 
are growing at a slightly faster pace. Penetration of 
private market investments within non-institutional 
portfolios remains low, but the addressable  
capital pool for private markets GPs is massive. 
Non-institutional assets total approximately  
$53 trillion globally, twice as much as is controlled 
by global defined benefit pensions, endowments,  
and sovereign wealth funds combined.6 However, 
while institutional investors allocate 27 percent  
of their assets to private markets on average,7 non-
institutional investors currently allocate just  
6 percent.

Retail’s growing relevance in the private markets  
is propelled by both demand and supply factors. 
With private markets asset classes outperforming 
their public market equivalents over the past 
decade, individual investors and their financial 
advisors are seeking incremental private  
markets exposure to improve absolute returns  
and increase diversification.

Regulatory changes are also stimulating demand.  
In Europe, amendments to the European Long Term 
Investment Funds in 2023 made private asset 
classes more accessible to individual investors by 
easing minimum investment and diversification 
requirements. And in the United States, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2023 
rulings mandating additional disclosures  
from GPs for all investor types has lowered the 
effective barrier to raising retail capital. 

Meanwhile, on the supply side, GPs, particularly 
large, multi-strategy managers, are actively targeting 
non-institutional capital to sustain their growth 
trajectories amid a fundraising slowdown from 
institutional investors. Moreover, the proliferation  
of investment products has substantially improved 
asset managers’ ability to raise retail capital. 
Products such as interval funds, tender offer funds, 
and a new generation of non-traded real estate 
investment trusts (REITs) and business development 
companies (BDCs) allow for more frequent 
subscription and redemption periods to meet  
retail investors’ liquidity needs. 

Of course, managing retail capital comes with its 
share of challenges. Intermittent-liquidity vehicles, 
for instance, require a separate and complex set  
of operational capabilities. An ecosystem of new 
technology solutions, including third-party digital 
wealth distribution platforms, is helping ease  
issues related to investor onboarding, subscriptions 
and redemptions, capital call tracking and 
collection, and reporting.

16

Private markets: A slower eraOther challenges are yet to be resolved. For 
example, fundraising from retail channels requires 
GPs to develop a revamped go-to-market approach, 
as non-institutional sales are almost entirely 
conducted through a B2B2C process involving a 
broad range of intermediaries. A one-size-fits-all 
sales approach is rarely effective. In addition, 
effective retail product distribution requires a 
proactive sales force to actively engage with—and 
educate—advisers. In addition to maintaining retail 
products and a distribution platform, GPs hoping  
to grow substantially in the space must also hire and 
train a salesforce that has deep relationships and 
experience in the retail channel.

These factors have contributed to substantially 
greater concentration of fund flows in the retail 
channel than in the institutional channel. The largest 
and best-known managers have captured up to  
50 percent of total fundraising in some strategies  
as a result of their investment in sales teams and 
brand marketing.8 Indeed, our research shows that 
the overall sales and service experience ranks  
high in the selection of alternative products, second 
only to investment performance.

Private markets: A slower era2

Private equity down 
but not out 

Higher financing costs, lower multiples, and an uncertain macroeconomic environment created a 
challenging backdrop for private equity managers in 2023. Fundraising declined for the second 
year in a row, falling 15 percent to $649 billion, as LPs grappled with the denominator effect and a 
slowdown in distributions. Managers were on the fundraising trail longer to raise this capital: 
funds that closed in 2023 were open for a record-high average of 20.1 months, notably longer 
than 18.7 months in 2022 and 14.1 months in 2018. VC and growth equity strategies led the 
decline, dropping to their lowest level of cumulative capital raised since 2015. Fundraising in Asia 
fell for the fourth year of the last five, with the greatest decline in China. 

Despite the difficult fundraising context, a subset of strategies and managers prevailed. Buyout 
managers collectively had their best fundraising year on record, raising more than $400 billion. 
Fundraising in Europe surged by more than 50 percent, resulting in the region’s biggest haul 
ever. The largest managers raised an outsized share of the total for a second consecutive year, 
making 2023 the most concentrated fundraising year of the last decade. 

Despite the drop in aggregate fundraising, PE assets under management increased 8 percent  
to $8.2 trillion. Only a small part of this growth was performance driven: PE funds produced a net 
IRR of just 2.5 percent through September 30, 2023. Buyouts and growth equity generated 
positive returns, while VC lost money. PE performance, dating back to the beginning of 2022, 
remains negative, highlighting the difficulty of generating attractive investment returns in  
a higher interest rate and lower multiple environment. As PE managers devise value creation 
strategies to improve performance, their focus includes ensuring operating efficiency and 
profitability of their portfolio companies. 

Deal activity volume and count fell sharply, by 21 percent and 24 percent, respectively, which 
continued the slower pace set in the second half of 2022. Sponsors largely opted to hold assets 
longer rather than lock in underwhelming returns. While higher financing costs and valuation 
mismatches weighed on overall deal activity, certain types of M&A gained share. Add-on deals, 
for example, accounted for a record 46 percent of total buyout deal volume last year.

18

Private markets: A slower eraFundraising
Globally, PE fundraising declined 15 percent to  
$649 billion in 2023, the lowest total since 2017. The 
asset class’s fundraising challenges mirror those 
affecting the broader private markets landscape in 
many respects. Consider the denominator effect, 
which more than 50 percent of LPs in a recent survey 
identified as having influenced their capital allocation 
decisions in 2023.9 Entering the year, LPs were 
overallocated to PE by 100 basis points on average, 
according to CEM Benchmarking. While public 
equity markets bounced back over the course of  
the year, exit volume fell 10 percent year over  
year, which helped drive up NAV (the numerator)  
and thereby mitigated potential relief from  
a rebounding denominator. 

Fundraising trajectories of the three main PE 
strategies diverged in 2023. Buyout managers 
collectively were more successful than they have 
ever been, raising $424 billion. Conversely, 
fundraising declined precipitously for both growth 
equity and VC, with the former declining 30 percent 
to $117 billion and the latter falling 59 percent to  
$98 billion, the lowest level since 2016 (Exhibit 10). 
This marked a reversal of fortune for VC: fundraising 
for the strategy had grown seven percentage  
points per year faster than buyout fundraising in the 
decade leading up to 2022. VC fundraising was also 
disproportionately impacted by the steep decline  
of Asia-focused PE fundraising—52 percent of the 
strategy’s fundraising from 2012–2021 came from 
the region versus just 12 percent for buyout.

Private markets: A slower eraNorth America–focused PE fundraising declined  
16 percent year over year to $424 billion, the third-
highest annual total on record. Consistent with  
the global trend, buyout fundraising in North America 
increased 26 percent to $281 billion, while growth 
equity fundraising declined 19 percent to $86 billion, 
and VC fundraising fell 67 percent to $49 billion. 
Last year was the first year in which growth equity 
funds raised more capital than VC funds in  
the region. 

Europe-focused PE funds had a record year in many 
respects. PE fundraising increased 57 percent  
to $159 billion, propelling Europe ahead of Asia in 
aggregate capital raising for the first time since 
2013. Buyout fundraising increased 87 percent to 
$122 billion, reversing a three-year negative  
trend. Europe is also now home to the largest buyout 
fund on record, which closed at $29 billion last  
year. Growth equity in the region surged 55 percent 
to reach $19.1 billion, surpassing VC, for which 
fundraising declined 25 percent to $17.3 billion. 

In Asia, PE fundraising declined 51 percent to  
$54 billion, the lowest since 2010. Fundraising in the 
region has declined 77 percent since its peak in 2018. 
The drop in China-focused fundraising played a sig-
nificant role in the decline, with only $22 billion raised 
in aggregate last year, compared to $205 billion in 2017. 
China’s share of PE fundraising in Asia has fallen 
from 86 percent in 2017 to 41 percent in 2023. Asia-
focused VC fundraising decreased 55 percent to 
$25 billion, growth equity fell 48 percent to $10 billion, 
and buyout declined 46 percent to $18 billion.

Meanwhile, fundraising in the rest of the world 
plummeted from $49 billion to $12 billion, following 
three consecutive years of growth. 

Concentration into larger funds 
Over the long term, the market structure in PE has 
remained remarkably consistent. For example, the 
share of dollars accruing to the 25 most successful

Private markets: A slower eraFundraising in 2023 was more concentrated than  
in any year of the prior decade, with 47 percent  
of all dollars raised accruing to just 25 managers 
(Exhibit 12). On an annual basis, fundraising 
concentration is heavily influenced by which funds 
are in the market in a given year, as well as LPs’ 
willingness and ability to back smaller and newer 
managers. In 2023, as was the case in the year  
prior, investors concentrated their allocations amid  
a broader pullback in commitments, allocations  
to existing managers persisted, and larger funds 
and their sponsors collected a greater share of 
capital. Consequently, new firm formation slowed. 
First-time funds raised $41 billion in 2023, the 
lowest total since 2013, as launching a new firm 
proved exceedingly challenging. Whether recent 
concentration is indicative of oft-rumored 
consolidation (a hypothesis strengthened by a 
recent spate of M&A) or is simply a cyclical capital 
rotation similar to past downturns remains  
to be determined. 

Consistent with the above concentration trend, 
managers raised (many) fewer but (much) larger funds. 
Dollars allocated to funds exceeding $5 billion grew 
8 percent year over year, while fundraising for vehicles 
of less than $1 billion fell more than 33 percent. 

The count of funds smaller than $250 million fell  
55 percent to 938, the fewest since 2013 and  
70 percent below 2021’s peak (Exhibit 13). Meanwhile, 
ten funds of at least $10 billion closed in 2023, the 
second most on record. As a result, the average fund 
size across PE strategies increased to approximately 
$497 million, up 67 percent year over year and roughly 
twice the average fund size in 2018.

Increased concentration among larger funds may  
in part reflect investors’ desire to limit risk in an 
uncertain market. Although the median performance 
of larger funds is generally comparable to that  
of smaller funds, the dispersion of returns among 
larger funds is relatively limited (Exhibit 14).

Private markets: A slower eraAUM 
Global private equity AUM increased to $8.2 trillion 
through June 30, 2023, and has grown 22 percent 
per year over the last five years. Within PE, the AUM 
mix has shifted considerably over time. Buyouts 
accounted for 47 percent of the global total as of the 
first half of 2023, down from 55 percent in 2018. 
VC’s share was 33 percent during the same period, 
up from 23 percent five years prior. 

Buyout strategies accounted for a majority share of 
European and North American AUM (74 percent and 
55 percent, respectively). In Asia, however, VC 
accounted for the majority of AUM, at 58 percent, 

followed by growth equity’s 23 percent and buyouts’ 
17 percent. The distribution of AUM in the rest of the 
world was more evenly split, with VC accounting for 
38 percent, growth equity 30 percent, and buyouts 
31 percent as of June 30, 2023.

PE dry powder grew to a record $2.2 trillion through 
the first half of 2023, driven by a dramatic slowdown 
in dealmaking while fundraising continued, albeit at 
a slower pace. Dry-powder inventory (the amount of 
capital available to GPs expressed as a multiple of 
annual deployment) increased from 1.1 years in 2022 
to 1.6 years in 2023 but remains within the metric’s 
normal historical range (Exhibit 15).

Private markets: A slower eraPerformance 
PE rebounded to post modestly positive returns  
in 2023, achieving a net IRR of 2.5 percent through 
September. However, despite the improvement, 
performance in 2023 was still the second worst since 
the global financial crisis.10 Buyouts (4.9 percent net 
IRR) and growth equity funds (3.0 percent) generated 
positive returns in 2023, while VC lost money  
(−2.9 percent) for the second consecutive year 
(Exhibit 16). VC’s underperformance in the  
current environment is not altogether surprising,  

as the high-growth, long dated cash flows that 
characterize most VC investments are inherently less 
valuable in a higher-discount-rate environment.

Despite recent challenges, long-term PE returns 
remain robust. PE has outperformed other private 
markets asset classes over the last decade. The 
median net IRR for PE funds launched between 2011 
and 2020 was 16.4 percent as of September 30, 
2023, exceeding even the top-quartile returns of  
all other private asset classes. At the top end,

Private markets: A slower eraPE’s performance has been exceptional,  
with top-quartile funds producing net IRRs in 
excess of 24 percent. 

Across strategies, buyout funds have generated  
the highest returns at every quartile, while VC  
has the widest variation in fund performance,  
a 16-percentage-point interquartile spread  
(Exhibit 17). Growth equity returns have been the 
least impressive, though dispersion of returns 
among growth equity funds is relatively low. 

Though PE underperformed public equities in  
2023 (the MSCI World Index returned 22.6 percent 
through the third quarter of 2023), it has out-
performed public equivalents over longer periods. 
According to the Kaplan-Schoar Public Market 
Equivalent analysis, which benchmarks PE perfor-
mance against a public market index by accounting 
for the timing of cash flows, the median PE fund 
from 2010–20 vintages outperformed its public 
market equivalent by 1.1 times. In fact, the median  
PE fund in every vintage during the measured 
decade outperformed public market equivalents.11

Private markets: A slower eraIn today’s environment, the drivers of investment 
returns for PE funds are evolving. According to  
an analysis by the StepStone Group, historical returns 
have been substantially driven by market multiple 
expansion and leverage (Exhibit 18). However, 
decade-long tailwinds of low and decreasing interest 
rates and expanding multiples have seemingly 
reversed, perhaps limiting fund managers’ ability to 
rely on these two sources of investment performance. 
Now alpha generation at the asset level—growing 
revenue and increasing margin—has become 
increasingly important for managers seeking to reach 
or exceed their return targets.

Deal activity
Higher interest rates led to a substantial drop in deal 
volume for the second consecutive year. After a 
frenzied 2021, during which volume spiked to an all-
time high of $3.4 trillion, and robust activity in the 
first half of 2022, dealmaking became more difficult 
in 2022’s second half. That slower pace continued 
through 2023, with deal volume totaling $2.1 trillion, 
down 21 percent from the prior year and 38 percent 
below the 2021 peak. Deal count fell more sharply, 
declining 24 percent to less than 54,000. Even so, 
2023 remained the third most active dealmaking

Private markets: A slower eraand recognize synergies. Non-platform deals 
represented 70 percent of the total buyout deal count 
in 2023, up more than 20 percentage points from 
2010 levels (Exhibit 21). As a percentage of buyout 
deal volume, non-platform deals accounted for  
46 percent, the highest ratio in more than a decade. 
Historically, GPs seek to benefit from the multiple 
arbitrage available from adding a smaller business 
(that, on average, trades at a lower multiple) to an 
existing platform (that trades at a higher multiple)  
in situations where the acquired companies  
are properly integrated and synergies have  
been proven.

Exits
Amid the broader decline in deal volume, PE exit 
volume fell substantially, as sponsors opted to avoid 
selling into a lower-multiple environment. Global 
exits by count declined 23 percent, reaching their 
lowest level since 2013. Measured by dollar volume, 
exits declined 10 percent to $840 billion, falling  
well below the past decade’s average annual volume 
of $1 trillion. 

The decrease in exits was particularly noticeable in 
North America, where PE exits (excluding VC) 
declined 28 percent by volume from the previous 
year. In Europe and Asia, exits fell 12 percent  
and 1 percent, respectively.12

Continued decline in exits has led to an increase in 
the average holding period for funds. In 2023, 
average holding periods reached a record high of 
6.8 years.13 Mathematically, funds with a longer  
hold period require a higher multiple of invested 
capital (MOIC) to reach similar IRRs, further 
emphasizing the importance of value creation and 
earnings growth in the current environment. 

Deal multiples and leverage
From 2010 to 2022, PE and public market multiples 
expanded steadily, with valuation growth in the 
private markets slightly surpassing that in public 
markets. The median buyout purchase price multiple 
increased from 7.7 times to 11.9 times EBITDA over 
this period.14 In other words, an investor had to pay 
roughly 50 percent more in 2022 than 2010 to

Private markets: A slower eraacquire the same EBITDA. Multiple expansion 
provided a consistent tailwind for investors through 
this period: of investments made since the Global 
Financial Crisis, nearly every investment was 
consummated in a lower-multiple environment than 
the environment into which it was exited.

Multiples’ upward march reversed in 2023, however, 
declining for the first time in a decade. Through 
September 30, 2023, the year-to-date median global 
buyout multiple fell by nearly one turn to 11 times 
EBITDA. Global public equity multiples decreased 

as well, declining to 11.3 times EBITDA through 
September from an average of 12.1 times in 2022 
(Exhibit 22). 

The largest year-over-year compressions in purchase 
price multiples (−1.5 times) occurred in information 
technology—which had experienced more than 
eight turns of multiple expansion from 2009 to 2021, 
the most among any sector—and in industrials. 
Financial services multiples bucked the trend (+0.2 
times, continuing a five-year expansion streak), as 
did communication services multiples (+1.1 times).

US buyout leverage declined by roughly one turn  
in 2023, falling from 7.1 to 5.9 times EBITDA for  
large corporate deals, and from 5.0 to 4.1 times for 
middle-market deals (Exhibit 23). Higher financing 
costs and lower valuation multiples contributed  
to a marked decline in the use of leverage from the 
previous year’s record high. 

Historical PE performance has been driven 
significantly by leverage, which accounted for 
approximately 50 percent of investment returns  

for buyout deals from 2010 to 2021, according  
to the StepStone Group. Reduced use of leverage  
in the current environment, combined with the 
higher cost of financing, will have a mitigating effect 
on investment returns for the current vintage of 
deals, all else equal. This trend, combined with lower 
exit multiples (should they sustain), will make 
operational improvements within portfolio 
companies critical for investment outperformance  
in the current environment.

Private markets: A slower era3

Real estate recedes

For real estate, 2023 was a year of transition, characterized by a litany of new and familiar 
challenges. Pandemic-driven demand issues continued, while elevated financing costs, 
expanding cap rates, and valuation uncertainty weighed on commercial real estate deal volumes, 
fundraising, and investment performance. 

Managers faced one of the toughest fundraising environments in many years. Global closed-end 
fundraising declined 34 percent to $125 billion. While fundraising challenges were widespread, 
they were not ubiquitous across strategies. Dollars continued to shift to large, multi-asset class 
platforms, with the top five managers accounting for 37 percent of aggregate closed-end real 
estate fundraising. In April, the largest real estate fund ever raised closed on a record $30 billion. 

Capital shifted away from core and core-plus strategies as investors sought liquidity through 
redemptions in open-end vehicles and reduced gross contributions to the lowest level since 
2009. Opportunistic strategies benefited from this shift, as investors turned their attention 
toward capital appreciation over income generation in a market where alternative sources of 
yield have grown more attractive. 

In the United States, for instance, open-end funds, as represented by the National Council of 
Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Fund Index – Open End Equity (NFI-OE) Index, recorded  
$13 billion in net outflows in 2023, reversing the trend of positive net inflows throughout the 2010s. 
The negative flows mainly reflected $9 billion in core outflows, with core-plus funds accounting 
for the remaining outflows, which reversed a 20-year run of net inflows. 

As a result, the NAV in US open-end funds fell roughly 16 percent year over year. Meanwhile, 
global assets under management in closed-end funds reached a new peak of $1.7 trillion as of 
June 2023, growing 14 percent between June 2022 and June 2023. 

Real estate underperformed historical averages in 2023, as previously high-performing 
multifamily and industrial sectors joined office in producing negative returns caused by slowing 
demand growth and cap rate expansion. Closed-end funds generated a pooled net IRR of  
−3.5 percent in the first nine months of 2023, losing money for the first time since the global 
financial crisis. The lone bright spot among major sectors was hospitality, which—thanks  
to a rush of postpandemic travel—returned 10.3 percent in 2023.15 As a whole, the average 
pooled lifetime net IRRs for closed-end real estate funds from 2011–20 vintages remained 
around historical levels (9.8 percent).

32

Private markets: A slower eraGlobal deal volume declined 47 percent in 2023 to 
reach a ten-year low of $650 billion, driven by 
widening bid–ask spreads amid valuation uncertainty 
and higher costs of financing.16 Deal flow in the office 
sector remained depressed, partly as a result of 
continued uncertainty in the demand for space in  
a hybrid working world. 

Closed-end funds
Global closed-end fundraising fell 34 percent year 
over year to $125 billion, the lowest total raised since 
2014. Fundraising volumes declined broadly across 
regions, albeit at different rates. Fundraising in North 
America fell 37 percent to $84 billion, marking the 
second consecutive annual decline off the 2021 peak. 
Despite the drop, North America continues to be  

the largest fundraising market. Fundraising in Asia 
declined 41 percent to $15 billion, while European 
fundraising fell a more moderate 14 percent to  
$22 billion. 

Fundraising declines were similarly widespread 
across risk strategies, with some thematic variation 
(Exhibit 24). Fundraising for closed-end core and 
core-plus funds, already a small share of the market, 
dropped 51 percent from the prior year, the largest 
drop among strategies. Since 2021, fundraising for 
the lowest-risk equity strategies has declined  
70 percent as investors shifted commitments toward 
strategies more reliant upon capital return. Despite 
this trend, fundraising for opportunistic vehicles, 
typically the largest segment in closed-end real 
estate, fell 18 percent to $55 billion.

Private markets: A slower eraReturns 
Global closed-end real estate funds returned  
−3.5 percent net IRR through the first nine months 
of 2023, the first time the asset class has generated 
negative returns since the Global Financial Crisis. 
The loss in 2023 follows a ten-year high of 26 percent 
posted in 2021, enabled by rapid rent growth and 
cap rate compression in certain sectors, and a 
modest 1.5 percent return in 2022 as those trends 
slowed or reversed.

Despite recent volatility in a challenging market 
environment, long-term returns for closed-end real 
estate funds remain relatively consistent. As of 
September 30, 2023, every vintage from 2010 to 
2020 has produced a pooled-net IRR between  
7.5 and 12.5 percent. The median net IRR for funds  
in that vintage set stands at 9.9 percent, which  
is in line with infrastructure returns and trails PE  
by roughly 600 basis points.

AUM
Total global real estate AUM in closed-end funds 
grew to a record high of roughly $1.7 trillion as of 
June 2023. The 13 percent year-over-year increase 
primarily came from capital flowing into higher-risk 
strategies (for instance, opportunistic), though  
with some regional variation. Asia was the fastest 
growing of the major regions, with AUM increasing 
by roughly 28 percent to $226 billion. In North 
America, AUM increased 16 percent to $989 billion, 
while European AUM increased 3 percent to  
reach $379 billion.

Despite a less productive year in fundraising, dry 
powder in closed-end real estate funds grew by  
19 percent in the first six months of 2023, spurred by 
a slow deal market, to reach a new all-time high  
of $548 billion. Over the last five years, dry powder  
in the asset class has grown by roughly 13 percent 
per year.

Despite recent volatility in a challenging 
market environment, long-term returns 
for closed-end real estate funds remain 
relatively consistent. 

34

Private markets: A slower eraMarket concentration
As in other private markets asset classes, fundraising 
became increasingly concentrated in 2023 as 
investors continued to favor established names and 
larger funds. Just five managers raised 37 percent 
of the aggregate closed-end fundraising in  
2023—the highest proportion since 2001 and up  
20 percentage points from 2021 (Exhibit 25). 

Managers raised fewer and larger funds during 
2023. The average size of closed-end real estate 
funds, for example, increased 17 percent to  
$418 million. In the markedly difficult environment 

for new entrants, the number of funds that closed in 
2023 totaled 457, notably fewer than 743 in 2022 
and the decade’s peak of 865 in 2021. 

Meanwhile, funds greater than $1 billion accounted 
for roughly 64 percent of the overall fundraising 
total, up from 51 percent in 2022. The shift to larger 
funds in a difficult environment is consistent with 
prior downturns, such as the Global Financial Crisis 
and the dot-com crash, and is perhaps a form of  
risk management for LPs. In real estate, larger funds 
outperform at the median, and the dispersion  
of returns among larger funds is relatively narrow

(Exhibit 26). Large managers leverage their scale to 
attract and retain talent, acquire diverse portfolios, 
engage in systematic joint ventures with operators 
(or acquire operating companies in their entirety), 
and invest in digital capabilities to enhance efficiency 
and gain valuable insights.

Open-end funds
Within open-end funds in the United States, as 
represented by the NFI-OE Index, distributions and 
redemptions exceeded contributions, reversing  
the 2022 trend. Nearly $13 billion in capital flowed 
out of US open-end funds in 2023, compared  
with net inflows approaching $3 billion in 2022 
(Exhibit 27). The reduction in net inflows mainly 
resulted from a 74 percent ($23 billion) reduction in 
gross contributions, which had reached a record 
high during the prior year. While dollars have flowed 
out of core funds for five consecutive years,  

the change in the overall trend was driven by net 
outflows from core-plus vehicles that experienced 
net outflows for the first time in two decades.

Returns
Open-end fund performance declined considerably, 
and the category fared worse than closed-end 
funds. NFI-OE funds returned −12.2 percent on a net 
basis, the first annual decline since the global 
financial crisis and a marked drop from the strong 
performance in 2021 and 2022. 

Given elevated interest rates and uncertain demand, 
cap rates expanded approximately 60 basis  
points to reach 5.1 and 5.7 percent in industrial and 
multifamily sectors respectively, while the office 
sector expanded by roughly 300 basis points, 
reaching almost 11 percent (Exhibit 28). Unlike last 
year, rent growth did not offset cap rate expansion 
contributing to lower returns in most sectors.

Private markets: A slower eraPerformance varied across sectors. The office sector 
posted the lowest annual returns (−17.6 percent), 
while hospitality assets produced the strongest 
returns (10.3 percent). In stark contrast to their high 
performance over the last several years, multifamily 
and industrial sectors posted returns of −7.3 and 
−4.1 percent, attributable to slowing rent growth17 
and expanding cap rates.

Net asset value 
The total NAV of funds included in the NFI-OE Index 
reached $309 billion, down 16 percent from  
$368 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the 
sharpest decline since 2010, when NAV fell  
20 percent. Still, over the long term, growth in NAV 
has been substantial, increasing 17 percent per  
year between 2010 and 2022.

Deal activity 
Global real estate deal activity declined in 2023, as 
it did in the second half of 2022, weighed down  
by the higher cost and lower availability of financing, 
combined with valuation uncertainty. Global deal 
volume reached a ten-year low, totaling $645 billion.

In the Americas, deal volume fell to a ten-year low, 
totaling $375 billion (Exhibit 29). Deal activity 
declined 29 percent to $94 billion in Asia–Pacific 
and 46 percent to $178 billion in EMEA.

The interest rate environment has left the real estate 
market in a state of suspended animation. Demand

Private markets: A slower eraask spread between would-be buyers and sellers 
has made it exceedingly difficult to transact. While 
sellers may be anchored to valuations calculated in a 
low-interest-rate environment and are reluctant to 
adjust downward, buyers face increased borrowing 
costs and anticipated economic headwinds. 

There is reason to believe that the bid–ask spread 
will narrow in the not-so-distant future. Bidding 
activity increased in late 2023, with the average 
number of bids per deal rising 16 percent.18

Global deal activity declined across all major sectors 
(Exhibit 30). Multifamily and industrial deal volume 
declined 57 and 38 percent in 2023, respectively, the 
second consecutive year of declines after reaching 
record highs in 2021. Meanwhile, office sector deals 
fell 55 percent, reaching a ten-year low of $133 billion. 
Prior to the mass adoption of hybrid work, office 
deals had represented the plurality of market 
volumes (see sidebar “Lasting effects of the pandemic 
on global real estate”). Now, with continuing 
uncertainty in sectoral demand, price discovery 
remains a substantial challenge.

Private markets: A slower eraLasting effects of the pandemic on global real estate

The behavioral changes caused by the 
pandemic—lower office attendance, 
accelerated migration out of cities, and less 
shopping in office-heavy neighborhoods—
will reduce demand for real estate in most 
superstar cities (those with a disproportion-
ate share of the world’s urban GDP and GDP 
growth). In a moderate scenario modeled  
by the McKinsey Global Institute,1 demand 
for office space in the median city studied  
is expected to be 13 percent lower in 2030 
than it was in 2019. In a severe scenario, 
demand is expected to fall by 38 percent  

in the most heavily affected city. Similarly, 
demand for retail space in the superstar 
urban cores could be lower in 2030 than it 
was in 2019. In San Francisco’s urban  
core, for example, the moderate scenario 
forecasts demand being 17 percent  
lower (exhibit), and the severe scenario 
forecasts a 26 percent decrease.

Demand for residences in superstar urban 
cores, before accounting for price adjust-
ments, could be up to 10 percent lower by 
2030 than it would have been without

the pandemic. That said, the demand for 
residential space in urban cores will remain 
higher than it was in 2019 in every city 
studied, except San Francisco and Paris. 
That estimate rests on the assumption  
that, although the wave of residents who left 
urban cores may not return, population 
growth in each city will return to its prepan-
demic rate by 2024. If population growth 
remains depressed longer, the impact on 
demand could be bigger.

In a moderate scenario, demand for office and retail space falls sharply 
from 2019 to 2030.

Private markets: A slower eraUS markets by sector
Performance in the multifamily sector in the United 
States declined last year due to expanding cap rates 
and softening rent growth. Deal volume was down 
61 percent to $118 billion from $305 billion in the prior 
year and well below the record high of $358 billion  

in 2021 (Exhibit 31). Multifamily assets collectively 
produced a trailing one-year return of −7.3 percent 
and have returned 6.0 percent per year over the 
trailing three-year period, as of the end of 2023.19

Private markets: A slower erayear high of 7.6 percent.20 However, the United 
States continues to remain structurally short of 
three million to four million housing units, as 
conservatively measured by Freddie Mac. More 
housing, particularly affordable housing, is needed 
to bridge this gap. 

The industrial sector continues to cool from 2021 
highs, which resulted from the pandemic-driven 
surge in e-commerce. Tenant demand has since 
slowed, resulting in a deceleration of rent price 
growth. In 2023, industrial deal volume fell to a five-
year low of $89 billion. According to the National 
Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries’ NPI 
Index, industrial assets produced a trailing one- 
year return of −4.1 percent and have now returned 
16.4 percent per year over the trailing three-year 
period. Meanwhile, absorption and leasing activity 
fell below prepandemic levels after two frenzied 
years: 166 million net square feet were absorbed 
during the year (down 60 percent year over year), 
and 810 million net square feet were leased (down 
18 percent year over year).21 Industrial vacancy rates 
rose to 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 
from 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, and 
rent growth fell to 6.4 percent, declining by four 
percentage points over the same period. 

The office sector remains under pressure from 
persisting demand uncertainty. Vacancy rates 
increased in the ten largest US office markets to  
a record-setting 16 percent.22 Though employee 
attendance may be stabilizing at approximately  
50 percent of prepandemic levels in the ten largest 
US cities, economic demand remains uncertain. 
Office assets collectively returned −17.6 percent over 
the last year and have now returned −5.5 percent  
per year over the trailing three-year period. The rise 
in interest rates has reduced construction activity, 
resulting in limited new supply after current projects 
complete. This scarcity may significantly tighten the 
premium space market within a few years.

The hospitality sector was a bright spot in 2023. 
According to NCREIF’s NPI index, it was the only 
major real estate sector that recorded positive 
returns last year, achieving a trailing one-year return 
of 10.3 percent. The sector has now returned  
8.6 percent per year over the trailing three-year 
period. Deal volume decreased by roughly 47 percent 
year over year. However, despite recording positive 
year-over-year performance, hospitality returns 
declined over each successive quarter, potentially 
as a result of the softening of the postpandemic 
rush in leisure travel and sustained decline in 
corporate travel associated with remote working. 
Meanwhile, the trailing 12-month revenue per 
available room (RevPAR) has consistently increased 
month over month, after a pandemic low in February 
2021, helped in part by the inflationary pressure  
on average daily room rates (ADRs).23

Finally, the retail sector remained relatively resilient 
amid economic uncertainty. In 2023, demand  
grew across an array of retail subsectors, store 
closures slowed, and minimal new supply supported 
occupancy. Still, retail’s performance was under-
whelming, posting a trailing one-year return of  
–0.9 percent (although the sector recorded the 
second-strongest returns among major real estate 
sectors after hospitality) and returning 2.0 percent 
per year over the trailing three-year period. At  
the same time, however, retail fundamentals have 
continued to improve over time. Demand for retail 
space in the United States grew more than 18 million 
square feet during the fourth quarter of 2023,  
the 11th consecutive quarter of demand growth.24 
Consequently, availability of retail space was  
4.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, the lowest 
ever recorded and 160 basis points below the ten-
year historical average of 6.4 percent. In such an 
environment, tenants have reported difficulty finding 
space: the trailing four-quarter leasing activity fell  
to 199 million square feet as of the fourth quarter of 
2023, nearly 20 percent below the average of  
237 million square feet recorded for 2015–19.

Private markets: A slower eraTransforming real estate with 
generative artificial intelligence 
Generative AI (gen AI) has taken center stage at  
a crucial time for the real estate industry. With 
softening demand and rising cap rates, real estate 
firms are fast recognizing that many applications  
of gen AI can enhance the operating performance  
of assets, improve processes, and ultimately 
increase returns (see sidebar “Real estate use  
cases for gen AI”).

McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimates that  
gen AI could generate $110 billion to $180 billion  
or more in value for the real estate industry.25 
AI-forward players can generate meaningful 
increases in net operating income (NOI)  
through more efficient operating models,  
stronger customer experience, tenant  
retention, new revenue streams, and smarter  
asset selection.

Real estate use cases for gen AI

Already, real estate players can enable several key use cases for gen AI:

 — Sifting through mountains of leasing 
documentation. Gen AI can analyze 
complex lease documents, making it 
easier for property owners and investors 
to find information at scale. The tool can 
summarize key themes, such as monthly 
rent and market factors, and generate 
tables of information based on specific 
parameters, like rent price per square 
foot. Professionals can then review the 
compiled information provided by  
the AI tool.

 — Copiloting real estate interactions. Gen 
AI can be used to create a powerful 
copilot―an AI-powered bot for various 
real estate interactions, including 
tenant requests and lease negotiations. 
The copilot can handle simple tenant 
requests such as routine maintenance 
by directly contacting the building’s 
maintenance staff. For more complex 
questions, the copilot can flag tenant 
needs for a specialist at a property 
management company.

 — Enabling visualization and creating 

new revenue streams. Gen AI tools can 
help potential tenants visualize exactly 
what an apartment would look like in, 
say, their preferred midcentury modern 
style or in cherrywood versus walnut 
finishes. This data can then be fed back 
into a model to predict which types of 
furnishings and finishes work best for 
different customer segments, which 
could improve prospect-to-lease 
conversion and shape future capital 
expenditure decisions.

 — Making faster, more precise investment 
decisions. Today, investment decisions 
are often informed through individual 
analysis of bespoke data pulls across 
sources. Gen AI can overlay this multi-
faceted analysis on a list of properties 
for sale to identify and prioritize  
specific assets meeting criteria for 
manual investigation.

 — Drawing architectural plans known to 
create desired outcomes. A gen-AI-
assisted process can introduce Internet 
of Things sensors and computer vision 
algorithms that collect data points on 
space use, such as how customers move 
through a store before purchase or 
when conference rooms are used in an 
office. The gen AI tool can then help 
develop architectural plans that are 
optimized to create desired outcomes in 
a space. Human architects and designers 
can work from these plans to ensure  
art and emotion in the design with less 
guesswork over whether a space is 
purpose driven. 

Gen AI will not replace analytical AI; for some 
use cases (such as producing a rent forecast 
or a retention prediction), more traditional 
machine learning excels. Rather, gen AI is 
opening up never-before-possible use 
cases relevant to portions of the real estate 
value chain that technology did not 
previously touch.

25 For more about gen AI and its potential role in the real estate industry, see Matt Fitzpatrick, Vaibhav Gujral, Ankit Kapoor, and Alex Wolkomir, 

“Generative AI can change real estate, but the industry must change to reap the benefits,” McKinsey Quarterly, November 14, 2023.

Private markets: A slower era4

44

Private debt pays dividends 

During a turbulent year for private markets, private debt was a relative bright spot, topping 
private markets asset classes in terms of fundraising growth, AUM growth, and performance. 
Fundraising for private debt declined just 13 percent year over year, nearly ten percentage points 
less than private markets overall. Despite the decline in fundraising, AUM surged 27 percent  
to $1.7 trillion. And private debt posted the highest investment returns of any private asset class 
through the first three quarters of 2023.

Private debt’s risk/return characteristics are well suited to the current environment. With interest 
rates at their highest in more than a decade, current yields in the asset class have grown more 
attractive on both an absolute and relative basis, particularly if higher rates sustain and put 
downward pressure on equity returns. The built-in security derived from debt’s privileged position 
in the capital structure, moreover, appeals to investors that are wary of market volatility and 
valuation uncertainty. 

Direct lending continued to be the largest strategy in 2023, with fundraising for the mostly-
senior-debt strategy accounting for almost half of the asset class’s total haul (despite declining 
from the previous year). Separately, mezzanine debt fundraising hit a new high, thanks to the 
closings of three of the largest funds ever raised in the strategy.

Over the longer term, growth in private debt has largely been driven by institutional investors 
rotating out of traditional fixed income in favor of private alternatives. Despite this growth in 
commitments, LPs remain underweight in this asset class relative to their targets. In fact, the 
allocation gap has only grown wider in recent years, a sharp contrast to other private asset 
classes, for which LPs’ current allocations exceed their targets on average. According to data 
from CEM Benchmarking, the private debt allocation gap now stands at 1.4 percent, which  
means that, in aggregate, investors must commit hundreds of billions in net new capital to the 
asset class just to reach current targets. 

Private markets: A slower eraPrivate debt was not completely immune to the 
macroeconomic conditions last year, however. 
Fundraising declined for the second consecutive 
year and now sits 23 percent below 2021’s peak. 
Furthermore, though private lenders took share in 
2023 from other capital sources, overall deal 
volumes also declined for the second year in a row. 
The drop was largely driven by a less active PE  
deal environment: private debt is predominantly 
used to finance PE-backed companies, though 
managers are increasingly diversifying their 
origination capabilities to include a broad new  
range of companies and asset types.

Fundraising
Global private debt fundraising fell 13 percent  
to $190 billion (Exhibit 32). Fundraising declined 
across geographies: in North America, which 
accounts for over half of the global total, fundraising 
fell by 15 percent, while fundraising in Europe and 
Asia declined 31 and 16 percent, respectively.

Fundraising for closed-end direct lending strategies 
decreased 29 percent from the prior year to  
$91 billion. Direct lending—the largest private credit 
strategy by a considerable margin—has driven the 
preponderance of fundraising growth for the asset 
class over the past decade. Dollars have accrued  
to the strategy in search of high (floating-rate) yields, 
with downside protection driven by a senior position 
in the capital stack. However, the slowdown in PE 
buyout activity and wariness over the potential for 
increased default and loss rates may have reduced 
investor appetite in the current environment. 

Fundraising for special situations strategies 
declined as well, falling 39 percent to $28 billion. 
The decline follows the three highest fundraising 
years on record for the strategy from 2020 to 2022. 
Supply-side timing (that is, which large funds are  
in market) and a backlog of dry powder are partially 
to blame.

Private markets: A slower eraIn contrast, fundraising for mezzanine funds increased 
62 percent to $43 billion, the highest total ever 
raised for the strategy. Three of the four largest 
mezzanine managers closed a fund in 2023, 
collectively accounting for more than 80 percent of 
all fundraising for the strategy during the year. The 
growth of mezzanine lending since 2021 indicates 
that investors may perceive the strategy’s flexibility 
to be especially relevant at this point in the  
credit cycle. 

Lastly, distressed fundraising recovered from  
an eight-year low in 2022, increasing 70 percent to  
$25 billion in 2023. The increase may reflect a belief 
among some LPs that higher interest rates and 
other macroeconomic headwinds will contribute to 
an improved deployment and return environment  
for the strategy in the near to medium term.

Consistent with other asset classes, investors 
concentrated their commitments in 2023 with larger 
debt funds and managers. Eight funds of $5 billion 

or more closed during the year (including the  
largest private debt fund ever raised, at $17 billion), 
collectively accounting for 38 percent of total 
fundraising. The top 25 managers, meanwhile, 
captured nearly three-quarters of all fundraising 
last year.

Private debt has exhibited a steady, gradual 
increase in fundraising concentration. On  
a trailing five-year basis, the top 25 managers  
in private debt captured 48 percent of all commit-
ments in 2023, 6 percentage points more than  
in 2018 (Exhibit 33). This evolution is perhaps 
unsurprising, as performance and fee levels are 
lower in debt than in equity strategies, making  
scale more critical to manager profitability. Scale 
also breeds competitive advantage: lenders  
with deeper pockets are more capable of offering 
borrowers various financing solutions, providing 
liquidity on short notice, and holding larger positions 
across various capital sleeves without taking on 
undue concentration risk.

Private markets: A slower eraAUM 
Private debt AUM increased 27 percent over the prior 
year to $1.7 trillion. North America remains the 
largest region, accounting for 62 percent of the total 
global AUM, roughly 2.4 times larger than Europe. 
Private debt strategies remain nascent in Asia, which 
accounts for just 7 percent of the global total. 

levels in at least five years. Banks and syndicated 
lenders returned to the market later in the year, 
driving spreads back in line with recent historical 
levels. Altogether, accounting for the impact  
of base rates that rose gradually throughout the 
year, yields on new middle-market unitranche  
loans remained above 12 percent for all of 2023 
(Exhibit 34).

Performance
In uncertain market conditions, private debt continued 
to provide investors with more consistent returns 
than other asset classes. The pooled net IRR for 
private debt for the first three quarters of 2023 was 
5.1 percent (6.8 percent annualized), the highest 
among all private asset classes.26

Direct lending yields peaked in the first quarter of 
2023, as an acute regional banking crisis and fears 
of larger contagion drove spreads to their highest 

Over the long term, private debt has produced 
modest but consistent returns relative to other private 
asset classes. The 2011–20 vintages, for example, 
generated a median net IRR of 9 percent through 
September 30, 2023, slightly below that of real 
estate and roughly seven percentage points below 
PE. However, variance in returns among these 
private debt funds, as measured by the interquartile 
spread, is the lowest across asset classes (five 
percentage points), less than half of the dispersion 
among real estate funds and a third of that 
generated by PE funds.

Private markets: A slower eraReturn profiles vary significantly across private debt 
strategies (Exhibit 35). Senior credit, predictably, has 
delivered both the lowest median returns (8 percent) 
and the lowest dispersion among funds, with a tight 
3.5-percentage-point spread between the top and 
bottom quartiles. Distressed and mezzanine 
strategies have produced higher median returns 
with higher volatility. Mezzanine outperforms 
distressed across all quartiles but with slightly 
higher dispersion across funds. 

Deal activity 
Comprehensive data on private debt deal volumes 
across strategies and geographies is limited by the 
opaque nature of activity in the space. In sponsored 
direct lending (private loans to PE-backed compa-
nies), available data suggests deal volumes declined 
16 percent to $187 billion from the prior year  
(Exhibit 36). The decline was mostly a result of 

reduced financing volumes for leveraged buyout 
(LBO) transactions, despite private lenders 
increasing their market share in this segment to  
an all-time high of 59 percent in 2023.27 

In non-buyout transactions, capital deployment was 
roughly flat year over year, indicating that, while 
direct lending deal volume remains highly levered to 
PE activity, it is not wholly dependent on LBOs  
for deployment opportunities. Much of the non-LBO 
deployment in 2023 served to refinance existing 
private or syndicated facilities, partly for borrowers 
repricing outstanding facilities to take advantage  
of lower spreads in the second half of the year. 
Another common driver of refinancing came from 
borrowers opting to extend in advance of an 
approaching maturity. This trend is likely to 
accelerate in 2024 and 2025, given that nearly  
$1.4 trillion of speculative-grade loans and bonds 
are maturing in the next three years.28

Private debt’s expanding footprint
The principal narrative underlying private debt’s 
rapid growth over the past decade has been that of 
private lenders stepping into the void created by 
banks’ exodus from the financing of highly leveraged 
businesses. Direct lenders have been the primary 
beneficiary of this trend, with AUM in the strategy 
growing a remarkable 15-fold, more than 30 percent 
per year, over the last ten years. Direct lending has 
been so newsworthy, in fact, that the term is now 
often used interchangeably with private credit as a 
whole, despite the latter encompassing a much 
broader set of strategies.

While the preceding pages detail several of these 
strategies (mezzanine, distressed, special situations), 
at least two are captured in other chapters of this 
report: private real estate debt and private infra-
structure debt. Though these strategies are small 
relative to their equity counterparts—16 percent  

of total real estate AUM and 12 percent of total 
infrastructure AUM, respectively—their share  
is growing: the comparable figures in 2012 were just 
8 and 5 percent.29 Growth in these real assets 
financing strategies has been driven by many of the 
same factors as growth in corporate private debt, 
including bank retrenchment (to a lesser extent thus 
far) and LPs’ quest for higher returns among their 
yield-oriented investments. Furthermore, as interest 
rates have increased, so have absolute returns 
available in real assets debt. Although these returns, 
due to the tangible nature of the collateral, are 
generally lower than those for corporate private 
debt, they have become more likely to clear GPs’ 
return hurdles. 

Private debt GPs are also extending into various 
forms of asset-based lending, including consumer 
credit, equipment leasing, and a wide range of  
other tangible and intangible asset types. Most of

Private markets: A slower eraalso announced in corporate private debt over the 
past year), the bank maintains the origination 
relationship with the borrower while entering into  
a “forward flow” agreement with a capital partner 
that ultimately funds the loan. Such an arrangement 
provides the GP with instant origination, which is 
generally considered to be the most differentiating 
component of the private credit value chain.

these assets are still predominantly financed by 
banks. In certain verticals, however, current market 
conditions and the impact of Basel III Endgame on 
bank capital requirements are creating a void in the 
market similar to that which emerged in leveraged 
lending more than a decade ago. Auto, unsecured 
consumer, and student loans are among the loan 
types most likely to transition away from bank 
balance sheets in the coming years. 

In certain areas, banks’ desire to preserve the value 
of their lending franchises has led to an element  
of “co-opetition” between banks and GPs. In most of 
these structures (notable examples of which were

Infrastructure and natural 
resources take a detour

For infrastructure and natural resources fundraising, 2023 was an exceptionally challenging 
year. Aggregate capital raised declined 53 percent year over year to $82 billion, the lowest 
annual total since 2013. The size of the drop is particularly surprising in light of infrastructure’s 
recent momentum. The asset class had set fundraising records in four of the previous five years, 
and infrastructure is often considered an attractive investment in uncertain markets. 

While there is little doubt that the broader fundraising headwinds discussed elsewhere in this 
report affected infrastructure and natural resources fundraising last year, dynamics specific to 
the asset class were at play as well. One issue was supply-side timing: nine of the ten largest 
infrastructure GPs did not close a flagship fund in 2023. Second was the migration of investor 
dollars away from core and core-plus investments, which have historically accounted for  
the bulk of infrastructure fundraising, in a higher rate environment. 

The asset class had some notable bright spots last year. Fundraising for higher-returning 
opportunistic strategies more than doubled the prior year’s total. AUM grew 18 percent, reaching 
a new high of $1.5 trillion. Infrastructure funds returned a net IRR of 3.4 percent in 2023; this  
was below historical averages but still the second-best return among private asset classes. And 
as was the case in other asset classes, investors concentrated commitments in larger funds  
and managers in 2023, including in the largest infrastructure fund ever raised.

The outlook for the asset class, moreover, remains positive. Funds targeting a record amount of 
capital were in the market at year-end, providing a robust foundation for fundraising in 2024  
and 2025. A recent spate of infrastructure GP acquisitions signal multi-asset managers’ long-
term conviction in the asset class, despite short-term headwinds. Global megatrends like 
decarbonization and digitization, as well as revolutions in energy and mobility, have spurred new 
infrastructure investment opportunities around the world, particularly for value-oriented 
investors that are willing to take on more risk.

51

Private markets: A slower eraFundraising
Global fundraising for infrastructure and natural 
resources fell 53 percent to $82 billion (Exhibit 37). 
The decrease in fundraising came on the heels  
of a record 2022 and a decade of consistent growth 
that was briefly interrupted during the early stages 
of the pandemic. 

Infrastructure fundraising was likely impacted by  
the same factors that lowered overall private markets’ 
capital haul, including economic uncertainty and the 
denominator effect. According to CEM Benchmarking, 
LPs’ actual allocations to infrastructure, on average, 
were roughly in line with their 3.1 percent target for 

the asset class as of the beginning of 2023—the 
first time in a decade that LPs were not meaningfully 
under-allocated.

The timing of fund launches was another factor 
contributing to slower fundraising. Infrastructure 
characterized by significant supply-side concen-
tration, so the timing of a handful of funds can have 
an outsized impact on annual fundraising totals.  
Just five funds, for instance, accounted for nearly half 
of 2022’s record fundraising haul. In 2023, only  
one of the ten largest infrastructure managers closed 
a flagship fund (which was, notably, the largest 
infrastructure fund ever raised, at $28 billion). Many

Private markets: A slower eraof these managers are currently in the market with 
funds expected to close within the next two years, 
making it likely that 2023 was more of an aberration 
than the start of a new trend.

Fundraising declines were broad based by region. 
North America fell 41 percent to $55 billion, Europe 
declined 69 percent to $20 billion, and Asia fell  
74 percent to $2 billion. The decline in fundraising  
in North America may be understated, and that  
in other geographies overstated, because many large 
vehicles categorized as North American have  
a global mandate and are likely to deploy some 
portion of their capital in Europe or Asia.

The decline in infrastructure fundraising was driven 
by dramatic decreases in its three largest strategies. 
The long-dated, fixed-return investments that 
characterize core and core-plus strategies fell out  

of favor (81 and 47 percent decline, respectively, 
from the previous year), largely because of the 
higher-interest-rate environment (Exhibit 38). 
Additionally, infrastructure value-added fundraising 
declined 83 percent year over year and represented 
just 8 percent of fundraising volume, after accounting 
for 23 percent of aggregate infrastructure and 
natural resources fundraising in the five years 
preceding 2023. 

Other strategies fared better. Fundraising for 
infrastructure opportunistic funds was up more than 
200 percent, infrastructure debt fundraising 
increased 11 percent, and natural resources fund-
raising grew 74 percent. However, since funds 
targeting these strategies are comparably fewer and 
smaller, even rapid growth on a percentage basis 
was not enough in absolute terms to meaningfully 
offset the declines in the larger strategies.

Private markets: A slower eraAUM 
Infrastructure and natural resources AUM grew  
to $1.5 trillion as of June 30, 2023, up 18 percent  
from the prior year. Geographically, 80 percent  
of the AUM is concen trated in the United States  
and Europe. 

Performance 
The pooled net IRR for infrastructure funds for  
the first three quarters of 2023 was 3.4 percent,  
well below the historical median performance  
of 10.2 percent.30 The lower performance is largely 
attributable to declining asset valuations, as the 
long-dated fixed cash flows that characterize many 
infrastructure investments became less valuable  
in a rising-rate environment.

Meanwhile, natural resources funds generated  
a pooled net IRR of 1.7 percent through September 
30, 2023, a stark contrast to the double-digit 
returns generated by the strategy in 2021 and 2022.31 
One cause of the underperformance was sharp 
decreases in energy prices. Crude and natural gas 
prices, which had more than doubled from 2020  
to 2022, fell significantly in 2023, with average WTI 
crude prices down 18 percent and Henry Hub 
natural gas prices down 61 percent.32

Looking ahead
Despite 2023’s lackluster fundraising and perfor-
mance results, infrastructure and natural resources 
continue to benefit from strong tailwinds. The 
energy transition continues apace and will require 
enormous amounts of capital that cannot be met  
by public funding alone. The rapid advancement of 
generative AI applications that require high 
processing power has further amplified demand  
for digital infrastructure. Capital buildout in the 
United States and several other large economies 
has become a government priority that crosses  
party lines, with many incentives and spending 
programs launched to support such initiatives. 

To capitalize on these opportunities in the current 
market environment, infrastructure managers  
are shifting their focus toward strategies further out 
on the risk-return spectrum. Value creation has 
become an increasingly large part of the investment 
thesis in many infrastructure investments, and 
investors are expanding beyond core infrastructure 
and logistics into other deal types, such as  
platforms and scale-ups. Crossover deals, including 
carve-outs and PE-to-infra deals that involve 
acquiring corporate targets with infrastructure-like 
characteristics (for example, data center cooling 
services, pallet pooling solutions) are becoming more 
common. Growth infrastructure is another 
burgeoning area, as evidenced by the launch of 
several funds focused on scaling smaller 
companies in sectors that include electric vehicle 
charging, modular data centers, and biofuel.

Private markets: A slower era6

Private markets make 
measured progress in DEI

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become an important part of the fundraising, talent,  
and investing landscape for private market participants. Encouragingly, incremental progress 
has been made in recent years, including more diverse talent being brought to entry-level 
positions, investing roles, and investment committees. The scope of DEI metrics provided to 
institutional investors during fundraising has also increased in recent years: more than half  
of PE firms now provide data across investing teams, portfolio company boards, and portfolio 
company management.33

In 2023, McKinsey surveyed 66 global private markets firms that collectively employ more than 
60,000 people for the second annual State of diversity in global private markets report. The 
research offers insight into the representation of women and ethnic and racial minorities in private 
investing as of year-end 2022. In this chapter, we discuss where the numbers stand and how 
firms can bring a more diverse set of perspectives to the table.

33 “The state of diversity in global private markets: 2023,” McKinsey, August 22, 2023.

55

Private markets: A slower eraThe statistics indicate signs of modest improvement. 
Overall representation of women in private markets 
increased two percentage points to 35 percent, and 
ethnic and racial minorities increased one percentage 
point to 30 percent (Exhibit 39). Entry-level positions 
have nearly reached gender parity, with female 
representation at 48 percent. The share of women 
holding C-suite roles globally increased 3 percentage 
points, while the share of people from ethnic and 
racial minorities in investment committees increased 
9 percentage points. There is growing evidence that 
external hiring is gradually helping close the diversity 
gap, especially at senior levels. For example,  
33 percent of external hires at the managing 

director level were ethnic or racial minorities, higher 
than their existing representation level (19 percent).

Yet, the scope of the challenge remains substantial. 
Women and minorities continue to be under-
represented in senior positions and investing roles. 
They also experience uneven rates of progress  
due to lower promotion and higher attrition rates, 
particularly at smaller firms. Firms are also 
navigating an increasingly polarized workplace 
today, with additional scrutiny and a growing  
number of lawsuits against corporate diversity and 
inclusion programs, particularly in the US, which 
threatens to impact the industry’s progress.

Private markets: A slower eraRepresentation of women across 
private markets 
Globally, women in PE were better represented than 
in the prior year. However, they continued to be 
under represented in leadership positions, reflecting 
historical imbalances in entry-level representation, 
lack of promotion parity, and higher attrition  
rates than for men. 

As of year-end 2022, 48 percent of entry-level  
roles in PE were held by women, similar to their 
representation in corporate America (Exhibit 40). 
However, the gender gap widened at senior levels. 
Representation of women in corporate America  
was seven percentage points higher than in PE at 
the managing director level and 11 percentage 
points higher at the C-suite level. 

While women continue to be well represented in most 
non-investing roles, gender parity remains distant  
in investing and operating roles (Exhibit 41). In entry-
level positions, for example, women made up  
59 percent of non-investing roles but just 33 percent 
of investing roles. Representation also falls steeply 
with seniority: the percentage of women in investing 
roles at the principal level, for instance, was just  
16 percent, 17 percentage points lower than entry-
level representation and 35 percentage points below 
non-investing principal representation. 

The industry made some modest gains in 2022.  
The share of C-suite roles held by women globally 
increased 3.5 percentage points to 17 percent. 
Similarly, representation of females in post-MBA 
investing associate roles—often a second  
entry point—increased to 29 percent, while

representation at the managing-director level went 
up to 15 percent. Although women’s representation 
in investment committees also has improved in 
recent years, women still made up only 12 percent  
of IC members in 2022.

Manager size appears to play a significant role in 
gender diversity. Firms with more than $100 billion 
in AUM are leading the charge toward gender  
parity in investing roles. Roughly 27 percent of their 
investing professionals are women, slightly above 
the global benchmark of 25 percent. These larger 
firms also have a much higher proportion of women 
in entry-level investing roles than those with  
$5 billion to 25 billion in AUM (38 percent versus  
26 percent). 

At almost every level, women in investing roles were 
promoted at significantly lower rates than men 
(Exhibit 42), and they continue to find themselves 
navigating a longer route to reach the same 

milestones as their male colleagues. Globally, men in 
investing roles were about 50 percent more likely, 
on average, to be promoted than their colleagues who 
are women. Turnover is also higher among women, 
whether for lack of promotion or other reasons. The 
global attrition rate for investing positions was  
16 percent for women, four percentage points above 
the rate for men. 

Differences early in the funnel can often result in a 
“broken rung” that makes it harder to achieve parity 
at higher levels on the corporate ladder. So as the 
pipeline for the next generation of women leaders 
grows, external hiring will continue to be an important 
lever for reaching gender parity. On average,  
34 percent of investing-track external hires into  
PE firms globally in 2022 were women (ten 
percentage points higher than female representation 
in investing roles at the start of the same year), 
signaling that a lateral hiring approach is helping  
to spur progress.

Ethnic and racial representation  
across private markets
Overall representation for ethnic and racial 
minorities increased one percentage point from 
2021 to 2022, though certain ethnic and racial 
minority groups con tinue to be underrepresented  
in the private markets. Over the past year, the  
most progress was made in the representation of 
ethnic and racial minorities on investment com-
mittees, which grew from 9 percent to 18 percent. 
Representation at the principal level also increased 
ten percentage points year over year. 

Similar to women, ethnic and racial minorities have 
better representation in entry-level positions than  
in senior roles. In the United States and Canada, 
ethnic and racial minorities accounted for 30 percent 
of all investing roles in 2022 but just 19 percent  
of investing roles at the managing director level 
(Exhibit 43). 

There are also significant variations among Asian, 
Hispanic, and Black professionals. Among racial 
minorities, Asian professionals held the largest share 
(20 percent) of all investing roles but just 12 percent 
of senior roles. Hispanic professionals held only  
4 percent of all investing roles, and Black investing 
professionals—one of the most underrepresented 
ethnic and racial minorities—held no more than  
4 percent of investing roles at any level. 

Promotion and attrition rates also vary by ethnic  
and racial group. White professionals are promoted 
the most across every level except principal.  
At the managing director level, for example, White 
professionals are over 2.3 times more likely to be 
promoted than any other race or ethnicity. Meanwhile, 
Black PE investing professionals have the highest 
rates of attrition, especially in the junior roles, and 
are over 50 percent more likely to leave their 
organizations than their White and Asian colleagues, 
which underlines long-term challenges with

attracting and developing Black talent in the

External hiring has a positive effect on increasing the 
representation of ethnic and racial minorities. In 
2022, 33 percent of external hires at the managing 
director level and 31 percent at the principal level 
were ethnic or racial minorities—in both cases, 
higher percentages than the existing representation 
levels (19 and 28 percent, respectively). 

address this variance in the coming years by 
implementing standardized, apples-to-apples 
approaches by which DEI progress can be tracked. 

More importantly, it is crucial for firms to embed and 
promote diversity and inclusion practices in all levels 
of the organization. Private markets firms seeking  
to continue improving representation of women and 
racial and ethnic minorities have several levers  
they can pull:

The path forward
The DEI landscape in private markets is changing, in 
no small part as result of the push from LPs to share 
data on DEI metrics during fundraising. However, 
GPs’ methods of calculating and reporting DEI vary 
considerably, as do the expectations and definitions 
of DEI held by LPs. The industry should look to 

 — Increase transparency with clear metrics and 

tracking capabilities. Firms can appoint 
champions to lead the creation and tracking of 
attrition and promotion rates by gender, 
ethnicity, and race, where possible, along with 
other measures of diversity, to shed light on  
their effectiveness in retaining and promoting 
diverse talent.

Private markets: A slower eraThe incremental progress across underrepresented 
groups, roles, and levels in private markets is certainly 
cause for optimism, but the work has just begun.  
The ongoing polarization around accelerating the 
pace of DEI initiatives across industries could  
cause disparate perspectives on how much DEI 
matters in the coming years. That variation is  
likely to have an impact on whether the industry  
can successfully shorten the time frame to  
reach parity. 

For a deeper exploration on DEI issues across private 
markets, please see our 2023 State of Diversity  
in Global Private Markets report.34 This annual study 
is one of the largest and most comprehensive 
studies of diversity in private markets firms globally. 
We invite private markets GPs and institutional 
investors to participate in our 2024 edition of the 
report. Please sign up here.

 — Diversify recruitment and hiring. To improve 
their hiring processes, firms can increase 
transparency and expand their hiring reach by 
diversifying their talent pool from universities, 
backgrounds, and geographies they may not 
have previously considered.

 — Debias the promotion processes. Unconscious-
bias and conscious-inclusion training minimizes 
the impact of unconscious prejudices on 
decision-making processes. To foster a more 
equitable promotion process, firms can be 
transparent about what is required for success  
in each role, with clearly defined objectives  
for advancement. Formal sponsorship and 
mentorship programs specifically for women and 
ethnic and racial minorities also can improve 
visibility in promotion processes.

 — Improve retention. Firms can improve retention 
by fostering an equitable and inclusive culture. 
Employee resource groups, generous leave 
policies, remote work, and child care subsidies 
are some potential tools for creating a more 
inclusive environment. Creating intentional 
on-ramps and off-ramps for employees as they 
transition to and from parental leave or extended 
time off can help normalize these journeys.
