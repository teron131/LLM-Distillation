The US film and television industry has an unmatched influence on popular culture and broader attitudes. The stories it 
tells and the trends it sparks reverberate in every corner of the country. 

This report explores the representation within the industry of the Asian and Pacific Islander (API) population—both 
actors on-screen and professionals in roles behind the scenes. It builds on previous McKinsey research examining 
the experiences of Black and Latino professionals in the entertainment industry, as well as on research about the 
representation and experience of Asian American workers.1 

Our in-depth analysis finds API representation has made significant gains over the past several decades. API stories 
on the big and small screens have become more prevalent, received critical accolades, and reached mainstream 
audiences. This progress is encouraging. But much work still remains before API actors and professionals catch up to 
their non-API peers on nearly all metrics. 

Industry executives should take note: API consumers represent one of the fastest-growing segments in the United States, 
and capturing their attention and imagination could generate billions of dollars in additional spending in the coming years. 
However, our research finds API consumers don’t perceive API representation in film and television to be authentic or to 
reflect their own stories, and this sentiment could be curbing their spending. 

Understanding current consumer attitudes toward film and television is a critical first step toward ensuring the industry 
creates work that connects more powerfully with API audiences. The next step is taking action to close the gap in repre- 
sentation in the industry and tell more authentic stories. This report analyzes in granular detail where there are further oppor- 
tunities for the industry to continue making progress on API representation in characters and stories in film and television.

McKinsey would like to thank Gold House—a leading not-for-profit organization that unites, invests in, and 
champions Asian Pacific leaders—whose contributions helped inform this report. We appreciate Gold House’s 
collaboration throughout the research process to introduce key stakeholders, provide input, and support the 
amplification of the findings. In addition, we thank the more than 100 industry experts and leaders who provided their

Introduction

By many outward measures, the Asian and Pacific Islander (API) influence on the film and television industry has never 
been greater. On-screen, for example, Everything Everywhere All at Once took top honors during the 2023 awards 
season, and Hong Chau is an ascendant star following her Oscar nomination for The Whale. Behind the camera, Chloé 
Zhao and Taika Waititi have both won Oscars and helmed Marvel Cinematic Universe films, putting them in the top 
echelon of Hollywood directors. Multihyphenates Mindy Kaling and Dwayne Johnson continue to create critically 
lauded projects. Meanwhile, a steady stream of overseas movies and TV shows over the past few years has included 
sensations such as Parasite, Squid Game, and RRR.

This recent success would seem to suggest that the entertainment industry has moved far beyond its history of API 
caricatures and stereotypes to champion real characters in front of the camera and greater representation behind it. 
But a look beneath the surface at the nuances of this progress reveals how far the industry still has to go. 

New McKinsey research has found that despite the abundance of content from the United States and abroad 
featuring API characters and storylines, more than two-thirds of API consumers are dissatisfied with the authenticity 
of their representation. API on-screen representation is dominated by content produced outside the United States; in 
US-produced film, for example, API actors are 3 percent of all actors, which is half of the API share of the US population. 
The roles the API actors play in US-produced content are either in hyperstylized action movies or written as race-
agnostic characters. Further, projects focused on API characters and storylines are less likely to get the promotional 
resources needed to reach a broader audience, so their impact on popular culture may thereby be limited. 

Why is greater API representation a source of opportunity for entertainment executives? Simply put, the industry is  
missing out on a significant opportunity to boost its bottom line. The industry is in flux: streaming services are seeking 
new sources of revenue, and movie studios are weathering uneven box-office trends. Studios have an opportunity to 
cast a wider, more inclusive net to bring content to new audiences. 

Asian American consumers1 on average earn 30 percent more than White consumers, but they spend 35 percent  
less than the average non-Asian American consumer on media (an average of approximately $526 for Asian American 
consumers compared with $788 for their non-Asian peers). Our analysis pegged the current gap in spending at  
$2 billion to $4 billion per year, a figure set to double to approximately $4 billion to $8 billion annually by 2060 if the 
Asian American population continues to grow as projected and income and spend patterns continue. 

This report examines the entertainment industry through multiple lenses to identify the factors contributing to the 
underrepresentation of API professionals in on- and off-screen roles across film and television. While the industry 
reflects some of the entrenched attitudes that APIs face in their daily lives, it also contains the seeds of a better 
path forward. This report offers a set of potential ideas the industry could pursue to expand opportunities for API 
professionals in film and TV, present more authentic portrayals of API characters, and motivate API consumers to spend 
more on entertainment. 

We acknowledge there is no single solution—addressing representation and authenticity is nuanced, and talent casting 
relies on an ecosystem of stakeholders. However, we believe the steps in this report could also motivate API consumers 
to spend more on entertainment, creating a virtuous circle within the industry.

1

The evolution of API representation  
in media

Examining the history of the API population in film and television in the past century is a challenging 
exercise in that it highlights pervasive stereotypes. The industry has made significant progress over  
the past 20 years, but our research indicates that API consumers perceive a lack of authenticity in the  
API characters they see in films and on TV. (For more about our definition of “API” and other terms,  
see sidebar “Terminology.”)

API representation has made progress through the decades, but stereotypes persist
For much of the 20th century, many API characters failed to rise above broad strokes or caricature. Often 
these roles were played by White actors, such as Mickey Rooney as a Japanese landlord in Breakfast 
at Tiffany’s. API actors did break through from time to time—for instance, Sessue Hayakawa received 
an Oscar nod for his role in The Bridge on the River Kwai in 1958. But it wasn’t until Bruce Lee gained 
acclaim for his martial arts films such as Enter the Dragon that the API community could point to a bona 
fide Hollywood star who looked like them. Still, API actors continued to be cast primarily in roles playing 
up stereotypes: male actors as action stars, their female counterparts as “hyperstylized and exoticized” 
characters—a pattern still present today.1

While the latter part of the 20th century saw some headway, progress was counterbalanced by films 
and television shows that either cemented these stereotypes or ignored the influence of Asian culture 
altogether. On a positive note, The Joy Luck Club, featuring an all-Asian cast, set a new precedent for API 
representation in media and grossed $33 million in 1993 (more than $71 million in today’s dollars). Margaret 
Cho’s All-American Girl, the first prime-time sitcom to focus on an Asian American family, premiered 
in 1994. In parallel, popular comedies such as Caddyshack and Sixteen Candles reinforced to an entire 
generation of moviegoers the perception that East Asian men were barely verbal fish-out-of-water comic 
relief.2 The Ring became a runaway hit in 2002, but few audience members were aware it was a remake of 
a Japanese film. Its success sparked a wave of such adaptations in subsequent years.3

Since the turn of the century, API representation has increased steadily, though not without missteps. 
Slumdog Millionaire won eight Oscars in 2008 but was criticized for the Western lens it applied to India.4 

‘ For such a long time, there was a total 
vacuum [of Asian and Pacific Islander 
stars], but now, there are actually people 
you can point to.’

More encouragingly, a string of films—Life of Pi, Crazy Rich Asians, Parasite, and Everything Everywhere 
All at Once—were lauded by critics and found wider audiences. On television, Fresh Off the Boat, which 
featured a Taiwanese American family as the main characters, ran for six seasons. Beef recently earned 
numerous accolades at the Emmy Awards for directing, writing, and acting, a reminder that well-executed 
storytelling has broad appeal.

API consumers don’t perceive their portrayals in media as authentic
Despite this recent progress, McKinsey’s 2023 survey of API consumers in the United States found widespread 
dissatisfaction with the authenticity of API portrayals in film and television. This sentiment is consistent with 
findings from The Asian American Foundation’s 2023 survey, which found about two-thirds of respondents 
across racial groups believe “Asian Americans are somewhat or highly inaccurately portrayed in film/TV.”5

In our survey of API consumers, less than 30 percent of respondents agreed that their identity is authentically 
represented in film and television (Exhibit 1). The negative perception of authentic representation is more 
acute for East Asians, Southeast Asians, and Pasifika respondents. The results highlight an opportunity to 
move the large group of respondents who are neutral into the positive perception category.

Throughout this report, we refer to the 
overall Asian and Pacific Islander (also 
Pasifika or Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islander) population as “API.” We use 
the term Pasifika to refer to the Pacific 
Islander or Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islander population. When appropriate 
(for example, if data is available only for 
certain segments of the population), we 
refer to specific subgroups.

AANHPI: Asian American, Native Hawaiian, 
and Pacific Islander, a subset of API; refers 
to people who identify as both Asian or 
Pacific Islander and American

APAC: Asia–Pacific; often used to refer  
to Asia and the Pacific Islands region of  
the world

API: Asian and Pacific Islander, a term  
used to refer to people who have ancestry 
from Asia or the Pacific Islands

Asian American: people of Asian descent 
who live in the United States; this group 
does not include Native Americans and 
Pacific Islanders

Pasifika: also referred to as Pacific Islander 
or Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander 
(NHPI); this group includes people who are 
ethnically Native Hawaiian, Samoan,  
or Chamorro

Key off-screen roles: directors, producers, 
showrunners, or writers

East Asian: people who are ethnically

Such impressions are also shared by API entertainment industry experts. In a separate survey of 
Hollywood executives, we found that more than 80 percent of respondents do not believe API experiences 
are widely represented in US-produced media. 

Our analyses of industry data and interviews with consumers and industry leaders found perceptions of 
inauthentic and inaccurate representation of the API population can be traced back to the combination of a 
few factors. In the next chapter, we will explore these factors as themes across both film and television.

From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in mediaExamining API representation in film 
and television 

Although the industry has made visible progress on API representation over the past several decades, 
this pattern has not convinced API consumers in the United States that their experiences and stories are 
being authentically portrayed. Getting to the root sources of this perception requires deeper examination. 

Our analysis found while overall numbers appear strong, thanks largely to content produced outside 
the United States, they mask underrepresentation in US film and television productions. This theme of 
nuances in disaggregation was also reflected in our research into Asian Americans in the workplace.6 As 
that report reinforced, the API population is not a monolith: understanding the real story requires a more 
granular examination of the data. 

When determining root causes of API consumer dissatisfaction, we focused on what individuals are seeing 
on-screen. In our survey of API entertainment leaders, 87 percent of respondents agreed the limited 
on-screen presence of API actors in domestic film and television is a primary reason API experiences 
aren’t better reflected in US media.

In this chapter, we explore trends in both film and television (multi-episode series) to highlight opportunities 
in API representation. Our findings are grouped into three themes: increases in API representation have been 
driven by content produced outside the United States, API actors are concentrated in certain genres in both 
film and television, and off-screen talent and on-screen representation appear to be mutually reinforcing.

Overall API representation has increased thanks to content originating outside 
the United States
The past two decades have seen a dramatic jump in films distributed in the United States with API 
representation in on-screen lead roles.7 From 2018 to 2022, API actors made up 14 to 20 percent of 
on-screen leads in US-distributed films, significantly higher than the API population’s share of the US 
population, at 6.2 percent (Exhibit 2).8

On the surface, this surge in representation might suggest the film industry has addressed any lingering 
issues. However, films produced outside the United States, especially those from the Asia–Pacific region, 
account for 70 to 90 percent of US-distributed films with API lead actors. This trend of API films produced 
outside the United States entering the US market accelerated with the rise in popularity of streaming 
services in the mid-2010s. Some of these films, such as Oscar winner Parasite, told stories that connected 
with US audiences more broadly.

This influx has caused representation to skyrocket—from just 2 percent in 2002 to double digits two 
decades later. Meanwhile, API representation in lead roles in films produced in the United States increased 
from 2 percent to more than 3 percent during that period, meaning API actors are underrepresented by  
50 percent in US-produced films when compared to the 6 percent API representation in the US population.

From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in mediaThis discrepancy contributes to a notable divergence: API content from other countries has boosted overall 
representation and connected with mass audiences, yet API consumers in the United States do not feel 
their stories are being authentically portrayed.

We see similarities in television, which has seen increased API representation—including some high-profile 
shows. Beef was a recent breakout success for US-produced content, both in popularity and among critics, 
while Squid Game became an unexpected sleeper hit for content that originated from outside the United 
States (see sidebar “Streaming and API inclusion”). 

Another way to gauge the impact and influence of films is to examine their box office revenues. For movies 
released in the United States from 2018 to 2022, API actors made up 14 percent of lead roles in films 
produced outside the United States and 3 percent of lead roles in domestic films. However, box-office

receipts highlight the differences in how US consumers take in US-produced and non-US produced content—
during the same five-year period, films with API leads produced internationally made up 2 percent of total US 
box office receipts, whereas those produced in the United States accounted for nearly 8 percent (Exhibit 3).

As one industry executive noted, “We know foreign films don’t have a track record for big box-office 
returns, so it’s not like the sheer number of movies means people are going to see that representation.”

Streaming services greatly expanded the 
amount of programming in production and 
democratized access to decades’ worth 
of content. They provide a platform with 
the potential for greater representation: 
in 2022, Asian and Pacific Islander (API) 
actors accounted for a 10 percent share  
of screen across the 462 most-watched 
titles on the top streaming platforms.1  
They have also opened the door to 
programs that might have been excluded 
when just a handful of channels acted  
as the gatekeepers of content in the 
United States. 

API representation on YouTube and social 
media platforms may be a leading indicator 

of future talent and streaming. Among the 
API entertainment leaders in our survey, 
85 percent agreed US-produced API 
content is more readily available on social 
media (such as YouTube and TikTok) than in 
traditional film and on television.

Over the past decade, API talent and 
creators have found on YouTube the home 
they were seeking in mainstream media. A 
number of API stars have amassed millions 
of followers on YouTube, a platform that 
allows young Asian Americans—“who 
often can’t find accurate depictions of 
themselves in mainstream media,” as CNN 
News correspondent Ted Rowlands put it—
to find content that resonates with them.2 

Wong Fu Productions, for example, has 
become something of an incubator of API 
talent, working with actors and musicians 
such as Randall Park, Simu Liu, and Far 
East Movement before they achieved 
mainstream success. More recently, 
creators such as Drew Afualo, Alan Chikin 
Chow, and Bella Poarch have made names 
for themselves on YouTube and TikTok.

API professionals also have a significant impact on their reach, societal influence, and consumer perceptions.

API content faces genre challenges in both film and television
API actor appearances are not all equal. A closer examination of the nature of lead roles and the 
representation of API actors in them can provide a more accurate view. As noted earlier, API actors account 
for about 3 percent of both lead and supporting roles in films produced in the United States—roughly half 
the level of API representation in the US population.9  

The story becomes even more nuanced when we dig into consumer perception of authenticity. Our analysis 
categorized films with at least one API lead from 2018 to 2022 by whether they were race-agnostic (films 
that do not have a storyline specific to the API experience but with API actors in roles that can generally be 
played by anyone) or API-specific (films with a storyline specific to the API experience or API actors playing 
characters whose API backgrounds and experiences contribute to the film’s overall story).

During the 2018–22 period, about 280 films had at least one API lead, and just over half of those were API 
race-agnostic (Exhibit 4). The percentage of API race-agnostic films was even greater when considering

were API race-agnostic; fewer films seen by larger audiences told API stories or featured characters with 
API backgrounds. We found a similar pattern in television episodes. From 2018 to 2022, more than  
55 percent of the approximately 903 episodes with API leads were race-agnostic. 

More than 80 percent of respondents to our survey of API industry leaders do not believe API experiences 
are widely present in US-produced media, a level in line with API consumer sentiments on authenticity. 
While our analysis didn’t attempt to define an “optimal” balance of race-agnostic and race-specific films, 
the low share of API race-specific stories in major releases could contribute to the low perception of 
authenticity for API consumers. 

Notably, this trend is not seen across all underrepresented racial groups. For instance, McKinsey’s 2021 
report on Black representation in Hollywood found that Black films were twice as likely to be race-specific 
than race-agnostic.10

Further, examining API films by genre tells another story. In the same 2018–22 period, out of the 32 wide 
theatrical releases with at least one API lead, almost half were action and adventure films, compared with 
30 percent of films with no API leads (Exhibit 5). The percentage of action and adventure films rises to  
71 percent for films grossing more than $50 million in the United States that have at least one API lead. 
While the reach and popularity of such films is welcome, API actors have fewer opportunities to portray  
the full breadth of authentic experiences reflected in their communities and upbringing.

theatrical release as the result of market forces. “Films based around [API] stories may feel limited to 
specific audiences; as successful as Everything Everywhere All at Once was, it is still an anomaly,” one 
leader noted. Investing in more of these independent films to broaden their reach may help to bring more 
API race-specific content to consumers. But as some shows demonstrate, API race-specific content 
doesn’t have to center entirely on the API experience; for example, Beef reflected the experiences of its 
characters’ ethnicities without feeling “the need to contextualize or overexplain itself for viewers outside 
the Asian American community.”11

As in film, the representation of API actors in television varies considerably by genre. Fully 35 percent of 
the 903 episodes with API leads were part of animated series, compared with 12 percent for shows without 
an API lead (Exhibit 6). The greater percentage of animated shows is driven by a smaller percentage of 
dramas and nonscripted shows (for example, reality TV).

These genre challenges make a difference when it comes to the perception of authenticity among API 
consumers. Industry experts highlighted the need for specificity in the portrayal of API characters 
(see sidebar “An imbalance across API subgroups”). One film executive noted, “It is really important to 
understand how multifaceted the community is and how important it is for our films and TV shows to 
represent that.” Another media executive said, “I worry about APIs being told as a single story. It hurts us, 
and it hurts the bottom line. We need to see the diversity within our community.”

The Asian and Pacific Islander (API) 
population includes many distinct 
subgroups, each with its own culture. 
The low perception of authenticity 
among API consumers could therefore 
be related to the disproportionate 
representation of certain subgroups 
(exhibit). For instance, in all films from 
2018 to 2022, 230 distinct API actors 

appeared in 310 lead roles. However,  
50 percent of these roles were played by 
actors of East Asian descent. 

subgroups of API consumers could feel 
overlooked by the film industry.

The 17 Pasifika lead roles were played by 
five men, and approximately 80 percent 
of them were antagonists or protagonists 
in action films (such as Jason Momoa in 
Aquaman). Given this distribution, some 

As one Pasifika entertainment executive 
put it, “Many API efforts still ignore the 
‘PI’ in the acronym. PIs are not pulled 
into spaces, but we are starting to see 
slow shifts and acknowledging this is an 
important first step.”

Off-screen talent and on-screen representation appear mutually reinforcing
In our interviews with experts in the entertainment industry, we delved into how off-screen talent and 
on-screen representation appear to reinforce each other. Executives sounded a common refrain: people 
in key off-screen roles (directors, writers, producers, and showrunners) have influence on who gets cast 
in on-screen roles, and lead actors often request to work with specific people or profiles. The cycle is 
mutually reinforcing.

12

4752SoutheastAsianEastAsianSouthAsianPasifika2+subgroups65513844364962100506Series 1From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in mediaOur analysis found the presence of API talent off-screen is correlated with higher API representation 
on-screen. Among US-distributed television shows with no API talent in key off-screen roles, about  
3 percent had at least one API lead.12 But more than 21 percent of shows with at least one API person in a 
key off-screen role had an API lead (Exhibit 7). The pattern is even more pronounced in US-produced films. 
Among movies with no API talent in key off-screen roles, just under 6 percent have at least one API lead.13 But 
when an API professional is in an off-screen role, the share of films with an API lead goes up to 37 percent.14

This dynamic highlights the question of cause and effect: are API lead actors getting roles because API 
off-screen professionals advocate for them, or the other way around? Further, are API professionals more 
likely to take off-screen roles on productions that feature API stories, or vice versa? Regardless, the 
correlation of these factors demonstrates the need for greater API visibility in media.

Digging deeper into off-screen roles in film, our analysis found films with API writers and directors are 
more strongly correlated with API leads than those with API producers (Exhibit 8). This discrepancy may be 
explained by the different influence of off-screen roles on creative decisions. Directors and writers have 
the primary decision-making authority in areas such as storylines and casting, while producers typically 
serve more as business partners. Accordingly, directors and writers may be able to more effectively 
advocate for on-screen talent.

For television shows, the presence of API leads is more highly correlated with API showrunners and 
producers than with writers and directors. In television, showrunners and producers exert influence over 
full seasons or even a program’s entire run, giving them greater impact on productions.

Ultimately, API professionals who build a proven track record in off-screen roles can attract investors to 
future API projects. Understanding the root causes behind the career barriers for API professionals in 
media will be crucial to increasing representation. Everyone in the ecosystem, from educators to senior 
executives, has a role to play. As one streaming industry executive said, “You bet on projects and who is 
behind them. When you have successful creators, studios won’t blink at investing in them.”

A multibillion-dollar opportunity for the  
industry and ideas for API representation

A closer look at spending habits reveals a significant disparity among consumers. Our research found Asian 
American consumers15 earn more income and spend less on film and television than other groups. Their lower 
spending could be attributed in part to the perceived inauthenticity API consumers see in film and television. 

Our analysis found that Asian American consumers earn approximately 30 percent more in annual income, 
on average, than their peers of other races,16 and they spend less of their income (70 percent for Asian 
consumers versus 78 and 81 percent for White and Black consumers, respectively). And they spend even 
less of their income on film and television—just 0.42 percent versus 0.87 percent for White consumers and 
0.94 percent for Black consumers (Exhibit 9).17

The differences in spending habits are particularly pronounced in cable, satellite, and streaming services. 
Asian American consumers spend 0.30 percent of their income, compared with 0.74 percent for White 
consumers and 0.74 percent for Black consumers.

which found API consumers believe they are not portrayed authentically in media. (Although the Pasifika 
population is not reflected in the spending data, our survey found just 26 percent of Pasifika consumers 
believe their racial and ethnic identity is authentically represented in US-produced television. The figure for 
US-produced film is 29 percent.)

Our survey also explored perceptions of authenticity and willingness to spend both money and time on 
media. Nearly half of API respondents living in the United States indicated they would spend more money 
on film and TV and spend more time consuming content if their own experiences were more authentically 
represented (Exhibit 10).18 This sentiment was especially pronounced among consumers aged 18 to 44, 
who represent a large portion of the rapidly growing population of API consumers.19

18  In our survey, 33% of respondents noted they would spend 1–50% more money, 13% would spend 51–100% more money, and 3% would spend 

more than 100% more money.

We used different methods to estimate the opportunity in revenues that the industry could achieve by 
increasing API representation and authenticity in film and television:

1.  a survey asking API consumers how much more they would be willing to spend on film and TV if they 

were more authentically represented

2.  raising film and TV spend by API consumers to the same percentage of income as non-API consumers 

(for example, White consumers)

Respondents who strongly disagreed that current API representation is authentic indicated they would 
increase their spending the most if the portrayal of API characters and stories were more authentic. The 
industry could improve service to these consumers by creating films and shows featuring portrayals that 
are more authentic to the API experience.

API leaders in the entertainment industry echo consumer perceptions. More than eight in ten respondents 
to our executive survey agreed that increasing on-screen API representation in US-produced content 
would result in higher spending by API households on film and television. As one entertainment executive 
said, “I spent years understanding what our consumers wanted, and they want authentic and nuanced 
stories about their community and other communities.”

3.41.97.64.1From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in mediaBy considering these factors in tandem—the underrepresentation of US-produced and API race-specific 
content, the perceptions of API consumers about the authenticity of API stories and characters, and 
API consumers’ lower spending on film and television—we can calculate the value of the opportunity in 
achieving greater visibility for and more authentic portrayals in API content. 

Our API consumer survey found that about half of API consumers would spend more on film and television 
if the content were more authentic to their race and ethnicity.20 To size this opportunity, consider that 
increasing the willingness of API consumers to spend on API-authentic content could generate about  
$2 billion in additional spending a year on film and television (Exhibit 11).21 In an alternative scenario, if 
API consumers spent the same share of their income on film and television as White consumers do, the 
opportunity rises to $4 billion annually. 

This potential broadening of the market for API consumers would help studios and streaming services 
as they find their way through a shifting consumer landscape. A Nielsen study found that streaming, 
including YouTube, has the greatest share of screen for API actors compared with broadcast and cable.22 
Asian Americans allocate 27 percent more time to streaming than the general population—a signal that 
increased representation could be key to greater engagement.

These figures likely underestimate the impact of greater and more authentic representation: more time 
spent on consuming content can result in higher advertising revenue in streaming and social media, and 
this indirect effect is not reflected in the Consumer Expenditure Survey.

Our analysis highlights two important takeaways for the industry. First, authenticity and quality are 
crucial. Second, spending marketing dollars to capture a greater proportion of this growing, high-income 
population segment may generate even more revenue. 

‘If you have an API person at the top,  
you are far more likely to see API folks

20  One in three said they would spend 1 to 50 percent more, one in ten would spend 51 to 100 percent more, and the remaining 4 percent would spend 

more than double.

21  Our consumer survey asked API consumers who indicated they would increase spending on more-authentic API content what their willingness 
to spend would be. The choices were 1 to 50 percent more than their current level, 51 to 100 percent more, and more than double. Our sizing 
methodology then used the Consumer Expenditure Survey data, divided the API consumer population into their respective categories of spending 
based on the survey results, and increased their spending using these factors as averages: 25 percent higher for the 0–50 percent group,  
75 percent higher for the 51–100 percent group, and 125 percent higher for the more-than-double group.

From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in mediaThe total value at stake will likely only increase in the future, given demographic trends. The US API 
population grew from 10.8 million in 2000 to 19.5 million in 2019, a jump of more than 80 percent.23 It 
is projected to almost double to 37.9 million—nearly 10 percent of the US population—by 2060.24 Our 
projections indicate that by 2060, the total opportunity to capture additional spending could rise to 
approximately $4 billion to $8 billion a year in today’s dollars, depending on the scenario.

Five potential ideas could help the industry to unlock the multibillion- 
dollar opportunity 
Addressing the visibility and authenticity of API representation in film and television could unlock 
significant rewards. One challenge is the breadth of stakeholders who must be mobilized: every film and 
television production involves scores of people making multiple decisions a day. As our analyses and 
surveys uncovered, the challenges for API representation span the industry’s entire ecosystem. 

External trends could create additional hurdles. For example, although API representation has 
experienced a noticeable increase over the past five years, industry experts are bracing for a potential 
decline. In our interviews, industry leaders pointed to the recent negative rhetoric in diversity, equity, and 
inclusion efforts in the United States; the industry strikes of 2023; and the waning sense of urgency about 
API representation since the peak of the “Stop AAPI Hate” era during the pandemic. 

There is no magic bullet available to the industry. Instead, improving API representation in media requires 
real change in how the production ecosystem operates—from decision making to pipeline development 
to how potential API projects are evaluated. Although we don’t have all the answers, we have distilled our 
analyses and discussions with industry leaders into a few big ideas that could help the film and television 
industry tap into this multibillion-dollar opportunity for API content: 

1. Increase the likelihood that API projects will be approved and distributed. Promoting API 
representation in leadership positions with decision-making authority can help authentic stories make it 
from the page to the screen. Industry leaders cited the lack of API professionals in key decision-making 
roles as one of the biggest barriers to greater and more authentic API representation in media. These roles 
include studio heads as well as acquisition and sales leads who decide what independent films to buy and 
distribute. Such decisions are crucial for emerging API creatives.

In addition, studios and investors could consider establishing funds to promote the development and production 
of API stories. For example, our analysis found that US-produced API films generated 8 percent of US box office 
receipts while accounting for just 3 percent of all US-distributed films, making a compelling business case for 
investment. Tracking and sharing these results on a consistent basis could help to inform decision makers.

An industry association leader said, “If you have an API person at the top, you are far more likely to see API 
folks in other roles. The traditional executives and buyers are not from our community, and it will be hard to 
make changes until we see more API professionals greenlighting shows and heading departments.”

2060,” US Census Bureau, February 2020.

19

From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in media2. Increase financial support for API projects and creators. As we noted, just a small number of API 
films receive broader distribution and promotional resources. In addition to securing marketing funds 
to successfully promote projects, studios need to invest in specialized resources to reach all audiences. 
Recently, multicultural marketing agencies and organizations have rallied influencers, press, and local 
grassroots organizations to promote API projects. Securing marketing funds can not only increase the 
possibility of commercial success but also boost the revenues and reach of successful films. A different 
approach, such as social media campaigns targeting influential groups, might help elevate API content on 
streaming platforms and reach the broadest possible audience. 

In addition, greater visibility into the performance of API content would require increased rigor and 
analytics capabilities to measure ROI, enabling the industry to adapt and adjust where needed. An industry 
executive noted, “Investors are looking for a unicorn, and they have so many projects and people to 
evaluate for their investments. Sometimes, they don’t know whom to invest in because it’s hard to measure 
success. They often take their money somewhere else, like Silicon Valley.”

3. Invest in API off-screen talent. Across film and television, providing API talent with the skills to become 
producers, directors, writers, and showrunners will be instrumental in improving API representation in front 
of the camera and sharing more authentic stories with audiences. Providing API professionals with the 
same opportunities as their peers calls for a greater emphasis on hiring and promotion for off-screen roles 
as well as investments in skill development. Expanding apprenticeships, internships, and other industry 
programs can give promising API talent new paths into the profession.

In our interviews, industry experts mentioned the lack of early and midcareer opportunities for API 
off-screen talent as an obstacle to career advancement (a trend also found in the non-entertainment 
corporate world25). Our analysis found three-quarters of limited theatrical release films with API leads were 
API race-specific films; many are independent films featuring a pipeline of up-and-coming API off-screen 
talent as well. As in other corners of the corporate world, new opportunities and investment in development 
for this talent can help API representation in the long run.

Organizations are now investing in emerging API talent to increase specialized skill sets in a variety of 
creative roles.26 For example, Starz and the Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment (CAPE) recently 
collaborated to create the CAPE Showrunners Incubator to develop and mentor API showrunners.27  

4. Expand the criteria for evaluating projects. Traditional comparables may not be the right way to evaluate 
the success of API projects. Just as non-US-produced API content has gained a foothold in the United 
States, US-produced API content has great potential to find international audiences. For example, the 
Asia–Pacific market has billions of consumers who could be interested in API content produced in the 
United States.

Broadening the definition of success for not just API projects but all projects (for example, including 
international box office potential and factoring in critical acclaim and social media engagement) could 
help the industry evaluate content from different perspectives. As one industry executive said, “We should 
reposition the API story as an early category that is consistently growing. The market in Asia has become a 
strategic imperative—the trends and growth all point there.”

20

From margins to mainstream: Asians and Pacific Islanders in media5. Continue to understand the state of API representation. Making progress over the long term requires 
regularly tracking data and identifying trends for specific groups and intersectionalities to understand 
both the state of representation and the factors that contribute to commercial and critical success. With 
this increased visibility, industry leaders could develop a shared understanding of persistent challenges 
and the most effective interventions. 

A better understanding of the API community’s subgroups could also improve authenticity in content. 
Today, many still see the API community as a monolith, with one point of view and voice. An API industry 
leader noted, “You are often the only one, and you are forced to represent a lot of viewpoints. API is a really 
big umbrella, especially the difference between the ‘A’ and the ‘PI.’ To have one person speak for all of that 
is nearly impossible.” These ideas are just a start. Given the changing nature of the industry, executives 
could also explore creative solutions to improve representation, such as analyzing the potential of ad sales 
through API content.

Our research demonstrates the film and television industry has several compelling reasons to champion 
API representation in front of and behind the camera. However, it doesn’t need to act out of altruism. The 
reward for getting it right could be a windfall of billions of dollars in annual revenues—and the prize will 
only grow. Capturing this opportunity would require a broader shift among decision makers in how capital 
is allocated for projects. Progress won’t be easy, but when the enhanced richness and authenticity of 
storytelling could be accompanied by such a substantial opportunity, the business case is clear.

To create this report, we collected and analyzed the following sets of data:

1. Luminate Film & TV data, with particular emphasis on data from 2018 to 2022
2. IMDb database and Box Office Mojo database, accessed November 2023
3. US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Expenditure Survey 2022
4. Qualitative interviews with API entertainment experts, conducted from May 2023 to April 2024
5. McKinsey API Consumer Survey, conducted in November and December 2023
6. McKinsey API in Entertainment and Media Expert Survey, conducted in November 2023

Film methodology

Data selection
For film analysis, we initially filtered the data to include domestic and foreign films distributed in the United 
States from 2018 to 2022. Subsequent analysis was conducted using this filtered data set, except for 
specified instances in which we included only domestically produced content.

On-screen and off-screen representation
Our data set included films with only on-screen or off-screen talent data. Therefore, the sample size  
varies by analysis depending on whether it includes on-screen talent, off-screen talent, or both. For 
instance, the presence or absence of on-screen data did not affect the inclusion of films in the off-screen 
representation analysis. 

• On-screen data, n = 6,164 films, 41,292 lead and supporting roles
• Off-screen data, n = 6,064 films, 16,208 off-screen talent slots
•  On-screen and off-screen data, n = 5,444 films (slot analysis not conducted when looking at intersection 

of on- and off-screen talent) 

During this data-filtering process, we excluded films with incomplete actor data (for example, those without 
data on actor ethnicity). Not all films had actor 1 through actor 10 data, but we kept those films and counted 
the available actor data.

TV methodology 

Data selection
For TV analysis, we filtered the data set to include TV shows distributed in the United States through broadcast,  
cable, or digital platforms from 2018 to 2022. In addition, we considered only shows with a running time of  
15 minutes to two hours. We conducted subsequent analysis using this filtered data set. This selection ensured  
our analysis focused on TV shows available to US audiences through various platforms.

On-screen and off-screen representation
Our data set included instances where TV episodes had only on-screen or off-screen talent data. 
Therefore, the sample size varies by analysis depending on whether it covered on-screen talent, off-screen

talent, or both. In other words, the presence or absence of on-screen data did not affect the inclusion of 
films in the off-screen representation analysis.

• On-screen data, n = 18,645 episodes, 89,443 lead and supporting roles
• Off-screen data, n = 27,695 episodes (slot analysis not conducted when looking at off-screen talent)
•  On-screen and off-screen data, n = 16,452 episodes (slot analysis not conducted when looking at 

intersection of on and off-screen talent)

During this data-filtering process, we excluded episodes with incomplete actor data (for instance, missing 
actor ethnicity). Not all films had actor 1 through 10 data. In such cases, we kept those films and counted the 
available actor data.

Data used in this report 

Data set
The data set used in this study consisted of 26,733 films spanning 1913 to 2023 and 4,057 TV series spanning 
1993 to 2022. The data was sourced primarily from databases such as Luminate Film & TV, IMDb, and Box 
Office Mojo. The film data included both foreign and domestic productions as well as data on budget and 
box office performance (domestic, international, worldwide), and details on off-screen and on-screen talent, 
including their names, ethnicities, and genders. Film genres were categorized by genre information from the 
IMDb database. Theatrical release information was obtained from Box Office Mojo.

Similarly, the TV data set comprised 98,424 episodes across 4,057 series, capturing information on 
running time, TV schedule, network type, budget, genre, and details on off-screen and on-screen talent. 
Titles were audited and evaluated using IMDb, extracting information such as title loglines, actor data, and 
theatrical distribution details. We leveraged IMDb and Box Office Mojo data (using trailers or commercials 
and plot summaries) to categorize content as race-agnostic versus race-specific.

Interviews and focus groups
To augment the data set, we conducted about 30 interviews and focus groups in collaboration with Gold 
House. These discussions involved mid- and senior-level executives and talent working in Hollywood, 
providing valuable insights into their experiences and perspectives. Interviewees came from organizations 
such as A24, Hillman Grad, Lionsgate, Marginal MediaWorks, and Universal.

Throughout the focus groups, participants were asked about their experiences. We also sought their feedback 
throughout the report’s development, and we conducted brainstorming sessions to generate recommendations 
for addressing the most pressing challenges faced by API individuals in the entertainment industry.

Surveys
Two surveys were administered to gather additional data for the research. The McKinsey API in Entertainment 
and Media Expert Survey had a sample of 103 entertainment industry professionals. Areas of focus included 
breadth of API representation in media and challenges within the industry. The McKinsey API Consumer 
Survey encompassing API individuals in the United States ensured representation across all age ranges and 
subgroups, with a sample of 1,000 respondents. The focus was on authentic representation in media and how 
authentic representation affects consumers’ spending and watching habits.
